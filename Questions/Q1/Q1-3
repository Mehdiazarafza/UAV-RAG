Consider this information:
The CPU resources allocated by the UAV server to the vehicle k computational tasks   fuk: 2.75 GHz
The ratio of vehicles’ computational tasks processed by servers at UAV side θuk: 0.68
The calculation task parameter D_k: 1.5 Mbit
The total CPU cycles required to process the computational tasks for vehicle k Ck: 1000 cycles/bit



"""question = """ Based on this information,  compute the computational latency for the tasks on the UAV side?
