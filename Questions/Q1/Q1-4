Consider this information:

The visibility distance (the maximum distance that one object can be clearly discerned) v: 20 km
The photonâ€™s wave- length : 451 nm
The size distribution of the scattering particles  q: 1.3



"""question = """ Based on this information,  compute the atmospheric attenuation factor in dB/km?
