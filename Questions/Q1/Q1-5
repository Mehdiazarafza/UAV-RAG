Consider this information:

The transmit power (p): 38 dBm
The path loss at reference distance (D0):131 dB
The distance between the LS and the 𝑖th UE(Ri):17m
The channel gain (hi):3.26
The path loss exponent (𝛼): 2.78


"""question = """ Based on this information,  compute the received power for a typical  User Equipment(UE) from the UAV-BS.
