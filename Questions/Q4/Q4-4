Consider this information:
The data rate requirements of user i (ɸi): 350 MB
The transmission power of the DBS pd: 0.1 W
The noise power level N0: -104 dBm/MHz
The average pathloss between the DBS and user i: 131 dB
Two solutions l1 and l2: 1, 1.5



"""question = """ Based on this information,  compute the utility ratio (ζ )that is associated to each user i. give the final result
