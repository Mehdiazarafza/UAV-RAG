Consider this information:
The bandwidth resources allocated by the UAV to each vehicle Buk: 20 MHz
The transmit power of the vehicle P_k: 0.1W
The noise power at the UAV σ^2:−169dBm/Hz
The channel gain between the vehicle and the UAV h_uk: 1.5
The calculation task parameter D_k: 1.5 Mbit

"""question = """ Based on this information,  compute the transmission delay of vehicle k transmitting data to the UAV is related to the uplink transmission rate.
