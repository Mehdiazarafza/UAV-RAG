Consider this information:
1-The data rate requirements of user i (É¸i):: 350 MB
2-The transmission power of the DBS pd: 0.1 W
3- The noise power level N0: -104 dBm/MHz
4- The average pathloss between the DBS and user i: 131 dB


"""question = """ Based on this information,  compute the exact amount of bandwidth
to a certain user to satisfy its data rate requirement bi?
