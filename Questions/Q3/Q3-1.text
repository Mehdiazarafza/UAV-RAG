Consider this information:
1.      user position: (47,23)m 
2.  	 UAV position: (65,73,15)m
3.  The LoS, and NLoS probability constants: 9.61, 0.16
    4. The probability of having a LoS connection (PLoS​) is 1.
    5. The carrier frequency(fc) is 2 GHz.
    6. The speed of light under normal conditions is \[3 times 10^8 \] meter per second 
    7. (μLoS): 3 dB

Based on this information,  Find the path loss for the line-of-sight (LoS) link between the ground user and UAV i
