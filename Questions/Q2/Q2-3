Consider this information:
The bandwidth resources allocated by the UAV to each vehicle Buk: 20 MHz
The transmit power of the vehicle P_k: 0.1W
The noise power at the UAV σ^2:-100dBm
The channel gain between the vehicle and the UAV h_uk: 1.5

"""question = """ Based on this information,  compute the data transmission rate between the UAV and the vehicle, which, according to Shannon’s second theorem ?
