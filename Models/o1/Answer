The UAV al"tude is assumed to be constant (h), and the coverage area radius is $R$. The UEs are distributed following a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) $\\Phi_{u}$ in a 2D plane with density, $\\phi_{u}$. The 2D UE distribu"on can be denoted by $S_{u}=\\bigcup_{x \\in \\Phi_{u}} B(O, R)$, where $B(O, R)$ is a 2D circular area with the radius $R$ centered at $O$. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we have denoted the OHP for deploying UAV-BS as $O \\rightarrow(0,0, h)$, and $O^{\\prime}$ is the projec"on of $O$ to 2D plane. This does not in any way imply that the OHP would always be located at the Origin or center of the environment. The actual OHP is determined based on the loca"on and distribu"on of the users in the network by following one of the approaches that have been proposed in the literature. However, it is essen"al to note that this is not the focus of our work. The parameter $v$ is the distance from $O^{\\prime}$ to a typical UE, while $\\theta$ is the angle formed by the projec"on of the LS to the 2D plane and the UE. Let the distance between the op"mal hovering posi"on $O$ and the LS be denoted by $\\Delta$. Then, we deﬁne the func"on $f(v, \\Delta)=\\sqrt{v^{2}+\\Delta^{2}-2 v \\Delta \\cos \\theta}$ to represent the distance between the UE and a point that is parallel to the LS (meaning the LS projec"on in the circular plane), and further deﬁne $R_{i}$ as the distance between the LS and UE in 3D space, such that $R_{i}=\\sqrt{h^{2}+f(v, \\Delta)^{2}}$. A single UAV deployment scenario is considered, and it is assumed that only the UAV serves the whole area. Hence, the interference is assumed to be negligible.  The channel model consists of the large-scale path loss and the Rayleigh fading component. For a typical UE, its received power from the UAV-BS is $P_{r}=P D_{o}\\leM|H_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|^{2} R_{i}^{-\\alpha}$, where $P_{r}$ is the received power, $P$ is the transmit power, $h_{i}=\\leM|H_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right|^{2}, h_{i} \\sim$ $\\exp (\\mu)$ is the channel gain and $\\mu=1, \\alpha>2$ is the path loss exponent, $R_{i}$ is the distance between the LS and the $i$ th UE, and $D_{o}$ is the path  Table 1 UAV-BS power consump"on parameters [41,43]. \\begin{tabular}{lll} \\hline Symbol & Meaning & Value \\\\ \\hline$\\delta_{c}$ & Proﬁle drag coeﬃcient & 0.012 \\\\ $\\rho$ & Air density & $1.225 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ \\\\ $r_{s}$ & Rotor solidity & 0.4255 \\\\ $R_{r}$ & Rotor radius & 0.2286 m \\\\ $A$ & Rotor disc area & $0.1642 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$ \\\\ $B_{v}$ & Blade angular velocity & $942.5 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$ \\\\ $\\kappa$ & Incremental correc"on factor & 0.1 \\\\ $W$ & for induced power & 161.5 Newton \\\\ $P_{o}$ & AircraM weight & 56 W \\\\ $\\eta$ & Circuit power & 2.6 \\\\ $\\tau_{t}$ & Ampliﬁer eﬃciency & 1 \\\\ $P$ & Normalized traﬃc load & 38 dBm \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}'),

ME speed: By deﬁni"on, the ME speed $V_{\\mathrm{me}}$ is the op"mal UAV speed that maximizes the UAV endurance under any given onboard energy $E$. With $E$ given, the UAV endurance with constant speed $V$ is given by $\\frac{E}{P(V)}$.

Alterna"vely, $V_{\\mathrm{mr}}$ can also be obtained graphically based on the power-speed curve $P(V)$, by drawing the tangen"al line from the origin to the power curve that corresponds to the minimum slope (and hence power/speed ra"o) [34], as illustrated in Fig. 1.

To proceed, how deployment and associa#on aﬀect the power consump#on of the ground users and UAVs should be described ﬁrstly.  To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$.

Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is. Therefore, the transmit power of the ground users will be op#mized through designing UAVs' deployment and associa#on in the following sec#on.  For UAV-base sta#on transmission, UAV $i$ at loca#on $l_{i}$ will collect all the ground users' data in cell $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and forward them to the remote base sta#on at $\\le{(x_{0}, y_{0}, h_{b}\\right)$.

COMPUTATION MODEL}  We assume that processing is performed on the server of the UAV or RSU only when the task data transfer is completed. Moreover, by performing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), the server is able to dynamically allocate its computa5onal resources based on the type or number of tasks arriving [21]. Let $f_{k}^{u}$ denote the CPU resources allocated by the UAV server to the vehicle $k$ computa5onal tasks and $F^{U A V}$ denote the total CPU computa5onal resources of the UAV. Thus we can obtain the computa5onal latency and computa5onal resource constraints for the tasks on the UAV side $$ \\begin{align*} t_{c p}^{u k} & =\\frac{\\theta_{k}^{u} D_{k} C_{k}}{f_{k}^{u}}  \\tag{8}\\\\ \\sum_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}^{u} & \\leq F^{U A V} \\tag{9} \\end{align*} $$  When the data from the UAV oﬄoad is received, the RSU starts the computa5onal processing process. Compared to UAV, RSU have larger computa5onal resources. Therefore, the alloca5on of RSU computa5onal resources will dominate the comple5on delay of vehicle-aware computa5onal tasks. This also means that the proper alloca5on of computa5onal resources to RSU will directly aﬀect the judgment decision of vehicle percep5on. Thus we use hierarchical analysis (AHP) [22] to analyze the priority weight of each vehicle's data fusion task among all data fusion tasks at the current phase. Then, the computa5onal resources of the RSU are allocated according to the priority weights so as to meet the diﬀeren5ated demands of diﬀerent vehicles' computa5onal tasks. First, we construct the hierarchical model with the priority weight of the vehicle, the calcula5on task parameters $S_{k}, D_{k}, C_{k}$ and the vehicle $k$ as the target layer, the criterion layer and the solu5on layer, respec5vely. Then, according to the hierarchical model, the judgment matrix $A=\\let(a_{i j}\\right)_{n * n}$ for each layer other than the target layer is constructed, where $$ a_{i j}=\\let\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{1}{a_{i j}}=\\text { rho, rho }=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}  \\tag{10}\\\\ 1, i=j . \\end{array}\\right. $$"),

Similar to the literature [17], we assume that there is complete granularity in the computa5onal task data par55on and the vehicle computa5onal task data can be divided into arbitrary propor5ons for oﬄoading. Therefore, in the second stage we use a par5al oﬄoading model where the UAV is able to divide the computa5onal tasks of vehicle $k$ into ﬁve parts. the UAV processes a part locally and forwards the remaining part to the ground RSUs for processing via relay.  Finally, in the third stage, the ground base sta5on performs priority weight calcula5on for some of the tasks received from vehicle $k$ and allocates computa5onal resources for processing according to the priority weight. In most computa5onally intensive applica5ons, such as face recogni5on and video analysis, the delay and energy consump5on required to process the results of the computa5onal tasks back to the vehicle side is much smaller than the delay and energy consump5on of the oﬄoading of the vehicle computa5onal tasks, so we ignore them [18].  \\sec5on*{A.

This is because the horizontal distances between the DBS and the users in the PoI increase as the DBS is placed further away from the PoI.

As a result, due to the limited backhaul link capacity, fewer sa"sﬁed users are connected to the DBS, which decreases the amount of bandwidth allocated to the sa"sﬁed users, thus signiﬁcantly reducing the access network bandwidth u"liza"on. On the other hand, the DBS placement incurred by BROAD leads to a more balanced u"liza"on between the FSO-based backhaul link and the access network, i.e., both of them are above $90 \\%$.

It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.

Thus, the transmit power for UAV $i$ to deliver one user's data to the base sta#on can be averagely computed as $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{p_{i}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)}{M a_{i}} \\tag{9} \\end{equa#on*} $$  Subs#tu#ng (4) and (6)-(8) into (9) yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{\\le{(2^{M a_{i} r_{u} / B_{v}}-1\\right) \\sigma_{v}^{2} K_{o} d_{i 0}^{2}}{M a_{i}} \\tag{10} \\end{equa#on*} $$  From (10), it is observed that the required transmit power for each UAV to relay data of one user depends not only on the UAV's posi#on $l_{i}$ (related to given deployment scheme) but also the user ra#o $a_{i}$ (related to associa#on scheme). It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission.

To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$.

Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is. Therefore, the transmit power of the ground users will be op#mized through designing UAVs' deployment and associa#on in the following sec#on.  For UAV-base sta#on transmission, UAV $i$ at loca#on $l_{i}$ will collect all the ground users' data in cell $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and forward them to the remote base sta#on at $\\le{(x_{0}, y_{0}, h_{b}\\right)$.

To proceed, how deployment and associa#on aﬀect the power consump#on of the ground users and UAVs should be described ﬁrstly.  To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$. From (5), it can be observed that $p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)$ is mainly determined by $d_{i}^{2}(x, y)$. Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is. Therefore, the transmit power of the ground users will be op#mized through designing UAVs' deployment and associa#on in the following sec#on.  For UAV-base sta#on transmission, UAV $i$ at loca#on $l_{i}$ will collect all the ground users' data in cell $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and forward them to the remote base sta#on at $\\le{(x_{0}, y_{0}, h_{b}\\right)$.

The A2 A communica"on links can be characterized by the Rice model that reﬂects strength of dominant LOS ( $\\rho$ ) and non-dominant NLOS paths ( $\\sigma$ ) and its probability density func"on is as below. $f(x \\mid \\rho, \\sigma)=\\frac{x}{\\sigma^{2}} \\exp \\lef(\\frac{-x^{2}-\\rho^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right) I_{0}\\lef(\\frac{x \\rho}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$ The Rician fading is shaped by the factor $\\mathrm{K}\\lef(\\rho_{0}, \\sigma\\right)=\\frac{\\rho_{0}^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}$ which is varying with the UAV al"tude, $h$ and can be approximated by a func"on of the height, $\\sigma=a h^{b}+c, a=212.3, b=-2.221, c=1.289$ and $\\rho_{0}=6.469$ [43].

Thus, $V_{\\mathrm{me}}$ is the op"mal UAV speed that minimizes the power consump"on, i.e., $V_{\\mathrm{me}}=\\arg \\min _{V \\geq 0} P(V)$ Though a closed-form expression for $V_{\\mathrm{me}}$ is diﬃcult to obtain due to the complicated expression of $P(V)$ in (6), it can be eﬃciently found numerically.

We use $B^{U A V}$ to denote the bandwidth resources that can be allocated by the UAV, so $B_{k}^{u}$ is limited by $B^{U A V}$ and the number of vehicles $K$ $$ \\begin{equa5on*} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} B_{k}^{u} \\leq B^{U A V} \\tag{4} \\end{equa5on*} $$  Consistent with what was men5oned above, all vehicles oﬄoad computa5onal tasks to the UAV.

Thus, the transmit power for UAV $i$ to deliver one user's data to the base sta#on can be averagely computed as $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{p_{i}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)}{M a_{i}} \\tag{9} \\end{equa#on*} $$  Subs#tu#ng (4) and (6)-(8) into (9) yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{\\le{(2^{M a_{i} r_{u} / B_{v}}-1\\right) \\sigma_{v}^{2} K_{o} d_{i 0}^{2}}{M a_{i}} \\tag{10} \\end{equa#on*} $$  From (10), it is observed that the required transmit power for each UAV to relay data of one user depends not only on the UAV's posi#on $l_{i}$ (related to given deployment scheme) but also the user ra#o $a_{i}$ (related to associa#on scheme). It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission. Aggrega#ng all the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network together yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} P=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}_{i}}\\le{[p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)+p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)\\right] f(x, y) d x d y \\tag{11} \\end{equa#on*} $$ which is obtained by taking the integral over the distribu#on on all areas $\\mathcal{A}_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$. Based on the above modeling, the op#miza#on problem ﬁnding UAVs' deployment loca#on and associa#on to minimize the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network can be formulated as $$ \\begin{align*} & \\mathcal{P} 1: \\text { Given : } \\beta, N, M, f(x, y), \\mathcal{A}, b_{1}, b_{2}, K_{o}, B_{u}, B_{v}, \\sigma_{u}^{2}, \\sigma_{v}^{2} \\\\ & \\text { Find : } \\Omega, l_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N} \\\\"),

Thus, the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i$ is $$ \\begin{equa"on*} d_{i}=\\sqrt{l_{i}^{2}+h^{2}} \\tag{1} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $l_{i}=\\sqrt{\\le~(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le~(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}}$ is the horizontal distance between user $i$ and the DBS.  \\sec"on*{A. Pathloss Model Between the DBS and the Users}  The wireless propaga"on channel between a DBS and a user can be divided into two scenarios, i.e., the link between a DBS and a user with LoS and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) connec"ons [26], [35], [36]. The pathloss in LoS is lower than that in NLoS since the signals from the DBS may suﬀer from much stronger reﬂec"ons and diﬀrac"on in NLoS [37], [38]. Thus, the average pathloss (in dB ) between a DBS and user $i$ can be es"mated by $$ \\begin{equa"on*} \\eta_{i}=20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)+\\rho_{i} \\xi^{l o s}+\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{n l o s} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $f_{c}$ is the carrier frequency, $d_{i}$ is the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i, c$ is the speed of light, $\\rho_{i}$ is the probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\xi^{l o s}$ and $\\xi^{\\text {nlos }}$ are the average addi"onal pathloss for the LoS and NLoS scenarios, respec"vely.

Constraint (11) means that the achievable data rate of the FSO-based backhaul link should be no less than the sum of the achievable data rates from the DBS to the sa"sﬁed users in the PoI.

Note that, to maximize the number of sa"sﬁed users, we need to minimize the allocated bandwidth to the sa"sﬁed users, while sa"sfying their data rate requirements. So, it is straigh\x82orward to allocate the exact amount of bandwidth to a certain user to sa"sfy its data rate requirement, i.e., $r_{i}^{a c c e s s}=\\varphi_{i}$. That is, $$ \\begin{equa"on*} b_{i}=\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{\\log _{2}\\le~(1+\\frac{p^{d} 10-\\frac{\\eta_{i}}{10}}{N_{0}}\\right)} . \\tag{15} \\end{equa"on*} $$  \\footnotetext{ ${ }^{2}$ Note that diﬀerent horizontal loca"ons may have diﬀerent minimum height requirements to ensure LoS between the MBS and the DBS.

Consequently, propulsion energy consump"on can be $E_{i}^{p}(t)=\\lef(P_{h}+P_{f}\\lef(v_{i}(t)\\right)\\right) \\cdot t$, where individual UAV velocity, $v_{i}(t)$ is determined by trajectory control.  \\subsec"on*{4.4.2. Communica"on energy consump"on}  For power consump"on for communica"on, UAVs use transmission power according to data rate. For instance, Soekris device consumes measured energy like 1.58 and 1.14 W as $P_{t x}$ and $P_{r x}$, respec"vely for 48 Mbps data rate with MCS 64-QAM $2 / 3$ [48]. Therefore, energy consump"on on A2 A and A2G links is varying with user traﬃc on them.  Power consump"on of an inter-UAV link $i j$ for the A2 A communica"ons consists of sta"c power consump"on of an ac"ve transceiver, $P_{0_{i}}=3.5 \\mathrm{~W}$ and dynamic power consump"on loaded by the amount of user data rate, $P_{i j}^{a 2 a}=P_{0_{i}}+P_{\\max }^{a 2 a} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}} f_{i j}^{u}}{r_{i j}^{\\max }}$ , where dynamic power consump"on of a A2 A link, $i j$ can be derived by propor"onal transmission power to maximum value $P_{\\max }^{a 2 a}$, which is traﬃc load on the A2 A link, i.e., aggregated user data rate, $\\sum_{u} f_{i j}^{u}$ over achievable data rate $r_{i j}^{\\max }$.  The total power consump"on of each UAV $i$ for A2 A links is $P_{i}^{a 2 a}=\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}} P_{i j}^{a 2 a}$ For A2G communica"on, an UAV as an air base sta"on provides sub-channels of OFDMA to mobile users. Similar to the A2 A communica"on, the power consump"on of the A2G link can be approximated by the user data rate. Power consump"on of the A2G communica"on is formulated as below, $P_{i}^{a 2 g}=P_{0_{i}}+\\Delta_{p} \\cdot \\frac{P_{\\max }^{a 2 g}}{\\lef|U_{i}\\right|} \\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}_{i}} \\min \\lef(\\frac{f_{i u}^{u}}{r_{i u}}, 1\\right), \\quad \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ , where sta"c power consump"on $P_{0_{i}}$ is 6.8 W and $\\Delta_{p}$ is 4 as a mul"plier for load-dependent power consump"on, which is comparable with pico-cell power consump"on [49]. Similarly, the transmission power on each A2G link iu can be scaled by user data rate $f_{i u}$ against link capacity, $r_{i u}$ with bandwidth $B_{i u}$ assigned for the GMU $u$; the access link bandwidth is evenly assigned to the individual user in this study.

Thus, the transmit power for UAV $i$ to deliver one user's data to the base sta#on can be averagely computed as $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{p_{i}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)}{M a_{i}} \\tag{9} \\end{equa#on*} $$  Subs#tu#ng (4) and (6)-(8) into (9) yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{\\le{(2^{M a_{i} r_{u} / B_{v}}-1\\right) \\sigma_{v}^{2} K_{o} d_{i 0}^{2}}{M a_{i}} \\tag{10} \\end{equa#on*} $$  From (10), it is observed that the required transmit power for each UAV to relay data of one user depends not only on the UAV's posi#on $l_{i}$ (related to given deployment scheme) but also the user ra#o $a_{i}$ (related to associa#on scheme). It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission. Aggrega#ng all the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network together yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} P=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}_{i}}\\le{[p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)+p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)\\right] f(x, y) d x d y \\tag{11} \\end{equa#on*} $$ which is obtained by taking the integral over the distribu#on on all areas $\\mathcal{A}_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$. Based on the above modeling, the op#miza#on problem ﬁnding UAVs' deployment loca#on and associa#on to minimize the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network can be formulated as $$ \\begin{align*} & \\mathcal{P} 1: \\text { Given : } \\beta, N, M, f(x, y), \\mathcal{A}, b_{1}, b_{2}, K_{o}, B_{u}, B_{v}, \\sigma_{u}^{2}, \\sigma_{v}^{2} \\\\ & \\text { Find : } \\Omega, l_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N} \\\\"),

To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$.

Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is. Therefore, the transmit power of the ground users will be op#mized through designing UAVs' deployment and associa#on in the following sec#on.  For UAV-base sta#on transmission, UAV $i$ at loca#on $l_{i}$ will collect all the ground users' data in cell $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and forward them to the remote base sta#on at $\\le{(x_{0}, y_{0}, h_{b}\\right)$.

Inter-UAV communica"ons}  The UAVs are supposed to communicate with each other using WLAN technologies such as IEEE 802.11a/g/n within several hundred meters. The air-to-air (A2 A) communica"on link is determined by a par"cularly dominant line-of-sight (LOS) link, while ground reﬂec"on is varying with al"tude. The A2 A communica"on links can be characterized by the Rice model that reﬂects strength of dominant LOS ( $\\rho$ ) and non-dominant NLOS paths ( $\\sigma$ ) and its probability density func"on is as below. $f(x \\mid \\rho, \\sigma)=\\frac{x}{\\sigma^{2}} \\exp \\lef(\\frac{-x^{2}-\\rho^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right) I_{0}\\lef(\\frac{x \\rho}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$ The Rician fading is shaped by the factor $\\mathrm{K}\\lef(\\rho_{0}, \\sigma\\right)=\\frac{\\rho_{0}^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}$ which is varying with the UAV al"tude, $h$ and can be approximated by a func"on of the height, $\\sigma=a h^{b}+c, a=212.3, b=-2.221, c=1.289$ and $\\rho_{0}=6.469$ [43].

Denote $(x, y)$ as the 2D coordinates of the DBS on a horizontal plane. Denote $h$ as the al"tude of the DBS. Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of users in the PoI and $i$ be the index of these users.

Pathloss Model Between the DBS and the Users}  The wireless propaga"on channel between a DBS and a user can be divided into two scenarios, i.e., the link between a DBS and a user with LoS and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) connec"ons [26], [35], [36]. The pathloss in LoS is lower than that in NLoS since the signals from the DBS may suﬀer from much stronger reﬂec"ons and diﬀrac"on in NLoS [37], [38]. Thus, the average pathloss (in dB ) between a DBS and user $i$ can be es"mated by $$ \\begin{equa"on*} \\eta_{i}=20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)+\\rho_{i} \\xi^{l o s}+\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{n l o s} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $f_{c}$ is the carrier frequency, $d_{i}$ is the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i, c$ is the speed of light, $\\rho_{i}$ is the probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\xi^{l o s}$ and $\\xi^{\\text {nlos }}$ are the average addi"onal pathloss for the LoS and NLoS scenarios, respec"vely.

Fig. 7 shows simpliﬁed schema"cs of the longitudinal forces ac"ng on the aircram in straight level ﬂight (see also Figure 13.2 of [34]), which include the following forces: (i) $T$ : rotor thrust, normal to the disc plane and directed upward; (ii) $D$ : drag of fuselage, which is in the opposite direc"on of the aircram velocity; and (iii) $W$ : the aircram weight. Due to the balance of forces in ver"cal direc"on, we have $T \\cos \\alpha_{T}=W$, where $\\alpha_{T}$ is the "lt angle of the rotor disc. Note that in prac"ce, $\\alpha_{T}$ is usually very small, so we have $T \\approx W$ or $\\kappa \\approx 1$ (see also Equa"on (4.3) of [33]).

Thus, the transmit power for UAV $i$ to deliver one user's data to the base sta#on can be averagely computed as $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{p_{i}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)}{M a_{i}} \\tag{9} \\end{equa#on*} $$  Subs#tu#ng (4) and (6)-(8) into (9) yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{\\le{(2^{M a_{i} r_{u} / B_{v}}-1\\right) \\sigma_{v}^{2} K_{o} d_{i 0}^{2}}{M a_{i}} \\tag{10} \\end{equa#on*} $$  From (10), it is observed that the required transmit power for each UAV to relay data of one user depends not only on the UAV's posi#on $l_{i}$ (related to given deployment scheme) but also the user ra#o $a_{i}$ (related to associa#on scheme). It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission. Aggrega#ng all the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network together yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} P=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}_{i}}\\le{[p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)+p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)\\right] f(x, y) d x d y \\tag{11} \\end{equa#on*} $$ which is obtained by taking the integral over the distribu#on on all areas $\\mathcal{A}_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$. Based on the above modeling, the op#miza#on problem ﬁnding UAVs' deployment loca#on and associa#on to minimize the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network can be formulated as $$ \\begin{align*} & \\mathcal{P} 1: \\text { Given : } \\beta, N, M, f(x, y), \\mathcal{A}, b_{1}, b_{2}, K_{o}, B_{u}, B_{v}, \\sigma_{u}^{2}, \\sigma_{v}^{2} \\\\ & \\text { Find : } \\Omega, l_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N} \\\\"),

To proceed, how deployment and associa#on aﬀect the power consump#on of the ground users and UAVs should be described ﬁrstly.  To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$.

Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is. Therefore, the transmit power of the ground users will be op#mized through designing UAVs' deployment and associa#on in the following sec#on.  For UAV-base sta#on transmission, UAV $i$ at loca#on $l_{i}$ will collect all the ground users' data in cell $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and forward them to the remote base sta#on at $\\le{(x_{0}, y_{0}, h_{b}\\right)$.

Constraint (10) indicates that the amount of bandwidth allocated to the users in the PoI should be no larger than the total amount of available bandwidth. Constraint (11) means that the achievable data rate of the FSO-based backhaul link should be no less than the sum of the achievable data rates from the DBS to the sa"sﬁed users in the PoI. Constraint (12) implies that, for each sa"sﬁed user, its achievable data rate should be no less than its data rate requirement. Constraint (13) deﬁnes the minimum and maximum al"tude of the DBS.  \\sec"on*{V. Backhaul-Aware Bandwidth Alloca"on and DBS Placement}  In order to eﬃciently solve $P 0$, we design the Backhaul awaRe bandwidth allOcA"on and DBS placement (BROAD) algorithm. The basic idea of BROAD is to decompose $P 0$ into two sub-problems, i.e., user access control (denoted as $P 1$ ) and DBS placement (denoted as $P 2$ ), and itera"vely solve the two sub-problems un"l the number of the sa"sﬁed users cannot be further increased. Note that, to maximize the number of sa"sﬁed users, we need to minimize the allocated bandwidth to the sa"sﬁed users, while sa"sfying their data rate requirements. So, it is straigh\x82orward to allocate the exact amount of bandwidth to a certain user to sa"sfy its data rate requirement, i.e., $r_{i}^{a c c e s s}=\\varphi_{i}$. That is, $$ \\begin{equa"on*} b_{i}=\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{\\log _{2}\\le~(1+\\frac{p^{d} 10-\\frac{\\eta_{i}}{10}}{N_{0}}\\right)} . \\tag{15} \\end{equa"on*} $$  \\footnotetext{ ${ }^{2}$ Note that diﬀerent horizontal loca"ons may have diﬀerent minimum height requirements to ensure LoS between the MBS and the DBS.

System Models}  The major nota"ons in the system models and problem formula"on are listed Table I. Assume that a DBS will be placed over or near a PoI to assist the users in the PoI in downloading traﬃc from an MBS via the DBS. Denote $(x, y)$ as the 2D coordinates of the DBS on a horizontal plane. Denote $h$ as the al"tude of the DBS. Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of users in the PoI and $i$ be the index of these users. Denote $\\le~(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ as the 2D coordinates of user $i$. Also, denote $\\varphi_{i}$ as user $i$ \'s data rate requirement. Thus, the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i$ is $$ \\begin{equa"on*} d_{i}=\\sqrt{l_{i}^{2}+h^{2}} \\tag{1} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $l_{i}=\\sqrt{\\le~(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le~(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}}$ is the horizontal distance between user $i$ and the DBS.  \\sec"on*{A. Pathloss Model Between the DBS and the Users}  The wireless propaga"on channel between a DBS and a user can be divided into two scenarios, i.e., the link between a DBS and a user with LoS and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) connec"ons [26], [35], [36]. The pathloss in LoS is lower than that in NLoS since the signals from the DBS may suﬀer from much stronger reﬂec"ons and diﬀrac"on in NLoS [37], [38]. Thus, the average pathloss (in dB ) between a DBS and user $i$ can be es"mated by $$ \\begin{equa"on*} \\eta_{i}=20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)+\\rho_{i} \\xi^{l o s}+\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{n l o s} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $f_{c}$ is the carrier frequency, $d_{i}$ is the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i, c$ is the speed of light, $\\rho_{i}$ is the probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\xi^{l o s}$ and $\\xi^{\\text {nlos }}$ are the average addi"onal pathloss for the LoS and NLoS scenarios, respec"vely. Here, $20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)$ indicates the free space pathloss between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\rho_{i} \\xi^{\\text {los }}+$ $\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{l o s}$ is the average addi"onal pathloss between the ![](hvps://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_10_1675c8bec89c92240cb0g-03.jpg?height=412&width=885&top_le~_y=208&top_le~_x=1029)  Fig. 2.

Access Link Data Rate Model}  The achievable data rate of downloading data streams from the DBS to users $i$ is $$ \\begin{equa"on*} r_{i}^{\\text {access }}=b_{i} \\log _{2}\\le~(1+\\frac{p^{d} 10^{-\\frac{\\eta_{i}}{10}}}{N_{0}}\\right) \\tag{4} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $b_{i}$ is the amount of bandwidth assigned to user $i, p^{d}$ is the transmission power of the DBS, $N_{0}$ is noise power level, and $10^{-\\frac{h}{10}}$ is the channel gain between the DBS and user $i .{ }^{1}$ Here, $\\eta_{i}$ is the average pathloss between the DBS and user $i$, which can be es"mated based on (2). From (4), it is easy to derive that the achievable data rate of user $i$ depends on the amount of allocated bandwidth and the pathloss, which is determined by the DBS placement.  \\sec"on*{C. FSO-Based Backhaul Link Data Rate Model}  FSO is applied to achieve the backhaul communica"ons between an MBS and a DBS. Note that the DBS placement must be able to establish LoS communica"on with the MBS, which is a cri"cal pre-requirement for FSO. In this paper, we assume that if the DBS is placed above a predeﬁned al"tude, denoted as $h^{\\text {min }}$, LoS can be maintained between the MBS and the DBS. Under the LoS condi"on, the achievable data rate of an FSO link can be es"mated by [40] $$ \\begin{equa"on*} r^{f s o}=\\frac{p^{f s o} \\tau^{t x} \\tau^{r x} 10^{-\\frac{\\nu L}{10}} \\vartheta^{2}}{\\pi(\\varepsilon / 2)^{2} L^{2} E_{p} N_{b}} \\tag{5} \\end{equa"on*} $$  \\footnotetext{ ${ }^{1}$ For a clear exposi"on, the shadowing and fading eﬀects are not considered in calcula"ng the channel gain. } where $p^{f s o}$ is the transmission power of the FSO transmiver at the MBS, $\\tau^{t x}$ is the op"cal eﬃciency of the FSO transmiver, $\\tau^{r x}$ is the op"cal eﬃciency of the FSO'),

S"ll, they apply diﬀerent methods to calculate the op"mal al"tude of the DBS. In par"cular, once the horizontal posi"on of the DBS is calculated, SOAP derives the op"mal al"tude of the DBS that can maximize the SE of the worst user in the PoI; the op"mal al"tude of the DBS in STABLE equals the average of the op"mal al"tudes of the DBS with respect to all the users (for example, if there are two users in the PoI and the op"mal al"tudes of the DBS with respect to the two users are 100 m and 200 m , respec"vely, then the op"mal al"tude of the DBS is 150 m ); STAR obtains the op"mal al"tude of the DBS by formula"ng an op"miza"on problem (which maximizes the sum of ![](hvps://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_10_1675c8bec89c92240cb0g-07.jpg?height=391&width=710&top_le~_y=210&top_le~_x=1114)  Fig. 3.

Simula#on Parameters}  Through all the simula#ons, the scenarios with three classical user distribu#ons (uniform user distribu#on, uni-modal user distribu#on and bi-modal user distribu#on) are considered. It is assumed that all the users are located within a target rectangular area $\\le{[-L_{x}, L_{x}\\right] \\#mes\\le{[-L_{y}, L_{y}\\right]$, where $L_{x}=$ 500 meters, $L_{y}=500$ meters, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Par#cularly, the probability density func#on for user uniform distribu#on can be expressed as $$ \\begin{equa#on*} f(x, y)=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{A}|} \\tag{20} \\end{equa#on*} $$ where $|\\mathcal{A}|$ represents the total area of the network. The uni-modal user probability density func#on can be described by the two-dimensional truncated Gaussian distribu#on, i.e., $$ \\begin{equa#on*} f(x, y)=\\frac{1}{\\eta} \\exp \\le{[-\\le{(\\frac{x-\\mu_{x}}{\\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{x}}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\exp \\le{[-\\le{(\\frac{y-\\mu_{y}}{\\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{y}}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\tag{21} \\end{equa#on*} $$ where $\\eta=2 \\pi \\sigma_{x} \\sigma_{y} \\operatorname{erf}\\le{(\\frac{L_{x}-\\mu_{x}}{\\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{x}}\\right) \\operatorname{erf}\\le{(\\frac{L_{y}-\\mu_{y}}{\\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{y}}\\right)$, the parameters $\\mu_{x}, \\mu_{y}, \\sigma_{x}, \\sigma_{y}$ are the mean and standard devia#on values of $L_{x}$ and $L_{y}$, respec#vely, and $\\operatorname{erf}(z)=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{z} e^{-t^{2}}$ is the Gauss error func#on. $\\le{(\\mu_{x}, \\mu_{y}\\right)$ represents the center of hot spot.

To proceed, how deployment and associa#on aﬀect the power consump#on of the ground users and UAVs should be described ﬁrstly.  To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$. From (5), it can be observed that $p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)$ is mainly determined by $d_{i}^{2}(x, y)$. Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is.

System Models}  The major nota"ons in the system models and problem formula"on are listed Table I. Assume that a DBS will be placed over or near a PoI to assist the users in the PoI in downloading traﬃc from an MBS via the DBS. Denote $(x, y)$ as the 2D coordinates of the DBS on a horizontal plane. Denote $h$ as the al"tude of the DBS. Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of users in the PoI and $i$ be the index of these users. Denote $\\le~(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ as the 2D coordinates of user $i$. Also, denote $\\varphi_{i}$ as user $i$ \'s data rate requirement. Thus, the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i$ is $$ \\begin{equa"on*} d_{i}=\\sqrt{l_{i}^{2}+h^{2}} \\tag{1} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $l_{i}=\\sqrt{\\le~(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le~(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}}$ is the horizontal distance between user $i$ and the DBS.  \\sec"on*{A. Pathloss Model Between the DBS and the Users}  The wireless propaga"on channel between a DBS and a user can be divided into two scenarios, i.e., the link between a DBS and a user with LoS and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) connec"ons [26], [35], [36]. The pathloss in LoS is lower than that in NLoS since the signals from the DBS may suﬀer from much stronger reﬂec"ons and diﬀrac"on in NLoS [37], [38]. Thus, the average pathloss (in dB ) between a DBS and user $i$ can be es"mated by $$ \\begin{equa"on*} \\eta_{i}=20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)+\\rho_{i} \\xi^{l o s}+\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{n l o s} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $f_{c}$ is the carrier frequency, $d_{i}$ is the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i, c$ is the speed of light, $\\rho_{i}$ is the probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\xi^{l o s}$ and $\\xi^{\\text {nlos }}$ are the average addi"onal pathloss for the LoS and NLoS scenarios, respec"vely.

Fig. 7 shows simpliﬁed schema"cs of the longitudinal forces ac"ng on the aircram in straight level ﬂight (see also Figure 13.2 of [34]), which include the following forces: (i) $T$ : rotor thrust, normal to the disc plane and directed upward; (ii) $D$ : drag of fuselage, which is in the opposite direc"on of the aircram velocity; and (iii) $W$ : the aircram weight. Due to the balance of forces in ver"cal direc"on, we have $T \\cos \\alpha_{T}=W$, where $\\alpha_{T}$ is the "lt angle of the rotor disc.

COMPUTATION MODEL}  We assume that processing is performed on the server of the UAV or RSU only when the task data transfer is completed. Moreover, by performing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), the server is able to dynamically allocate its computa5onal resources based on the type or number of tasks arriving [21]. Let $f_{k}^{u}$ denote the CPU resources allocated by the UAV server to the vehicle $k$ computa5onal tasks and $F^{U A V}$ denote the total CPU computa5onal resources of the UAV. Thus we can obtain the computa5onal latency and computa5onal resource constraints for the tasks on the UAV side $$ \\begin{align*} t_{c p}^{u k} & =\\frac{\\theta_{k}^{u} D_{k} C_{k}}{f_{k}^{u}}  \\tag{8}\\\\ \\sum_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}^{u} & \\leq F^{U A V} \\tag{9} \\end{align*} $$  When the data from the UAV oﬄoad is received, the RSU starts the computa5onal processing process. Compared to UAV, RSU have larger computa5onal resources. Therefore, the alloca5on of RSU computa5onal resources will dominate the comple5on delay of vehicle-aware computa5onal tasks. This also means that the proper alloca5on of computa5onal resources to RSU will directly aﬀect the judgment decision of vehicle percep5on. Thus we use hierarchical analysis (AHP) [22] to analyze the priority weight of each vehicle's data fusion task among all data fusion tasks at the current phase. Then, the computa5onal resources of the RSU are allocated according to the priority weights so as to meet the diﬀeren5ated demands of diﬀerent vehicles' computa5onal tasks. First, we construct the hierarchical model with the priority weight of the vehicle, the calcula5on task parameters $S_{k}, D_{k}, C_{k}$ and the vehicle $k$ as the target layer, the criterion layer and the solu5on layer, respec5vely. Then, according to the hierarchical model, the judgment matrix $A=\\let(a_{i j}\\right)_{n * n}$ for each layer other than the target layer is constructed, where $$ a_{i j}=\\let\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{1}{a_{i j}}=\\text { rho, rho }=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}  \\tag{10}\\\\ 1, i=j . \\end{array}\\right. $$")]}

Thus, the average pathloss (in dB ) between a DBS and user $i$ can be es"mated by $$ \\begin{equa"on*} \\eta_{i}=20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)+\\rho_{i} \\xi^{l o s}+\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{n l o s} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $f_{c}$ is the carrier frequency, $d_{i}$ is the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i, c$ is the speed of light, $\\rho_{i}$ is the probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\xi^{l o s}$ and $\\xi^{\\text {nlos }}$ are the average addi"onal pathloss for the LoS and NLoS scenarios, respec"vely. Here, $20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)$ indicates the free space pathloss between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\rho_{i} \\xi^{\\text {los }}+$ $\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{l o s}$ is the average addi"onal pathloss between the ![](hvps://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_10_1675c8bec89c92240cb0g-03.jpg?height=412&width=885&top_le~_y=208&top_le~_x=1029)  Fig. 2.

From (4), it is easy to derive that the achievable data rate of user $i$ depends on the amount of allocated bandwidth and the pathloss, which is determined by the DBS placement.  \\sec"on*{C. FSO-Based Backhaul Link Data Rate Model}  FSO is applied to achieve the backhaul communica"ons between an MBS and a DBS. Note that the DBS placement must be able to establish LoS communica"on with the MBS, which is a cri"cal pre-requirement for FSO. In this paper, we assume that if the DBS is placed above a predeﬁned al"tude, denoted as $h^{\\text {min }}$, LoS can be maintained between the MBS and the DBS. Under the LoS condi"on, the achievable data rate of an FSO link can be es"mated by [40] $$ \\begin{equa"on*} r^{f s o}=\\frac{p^{f s o} \\tau^{t x} \\tau^{r x} 10^{-\\frac{\\nu L}{10}} \\vartheta^{2}}{\\pi(\\varepsilon / 2)^{2} L^{2} E_{p} N_{b}} \\tag{5} \\end{equa"on*} $$  \\footnotetext{ ${ }^{1}$ For a clear exposi"on, the shadowing and fading eﬀects are not considered in calcula"ng the channel gain. } where $p^{f s o}$ is the transmission power of the FSO transmiver at the MBS, $\\tau^{t x}$ is the op"cal eﬃciency of the FSO transmiver, $\\tau^{r x}$ is the op"cal eﬃciency of the FSO'),

Consequently, propulsion energy consump"on can be $E_{i}^{p}(t)=\\lef(P_{h}+P_{f}\\lef(v_{i}(t)\\right)\\right) \\cdot t$, where individual UAV velocity, $v_{i}(t)$ is determined by trajectory control.  \\subsec"on*{4.4.2. Communica"on energy consump"on}  For power consump"on for communica"on, UAVs use transmission power according to data rate. For instance, Soekris device consumes measured energy like 1.58 and 1.14 W as $P_{t x}$ and $P_{r x}$, respec"vely for 48 Mbps data rate with MCS 64-QAM $2 / 3$ [48]. Therefore, energy consump"on on A2 A and A2G links is varying with user traﬃc on them.  Power consump"on of an inter-UAV link $i j$ for the A2 A communica"ons consists of sta"c power consump"on of an ac"ve transceiver, $P_{0_{i}}=3.5 \\mathrm{~W}$ and dynamic power consump"on loaded by the amount of user data rate, $P_{i j}^{a 2 a}=P_{0_{i}}+P_{\\max }^{a 2 a} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}} f_{i j}^{u}}{r_{i j}^{\\max }}$ , where dynamic power consump"on of a A2 A link, $i j$ can be derived by propor"onal transmission power to maximum value $P_{\\max }^{a 2 a}$, which is traﬃc load on the A2 A link, i.e., aggregated user data rate, $\\sum_{u} f_{i j}^{u}$ over achievable data rate $r_{i j}^{\\max }$.  The total power consump"on of each UAV $i$ for A2 A links is $P_{i}^{a 2 a}=\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}} P_{i j}^{a 2 a}$ For A2G communica"on, an UAV as an air base sta"on provides sub-channels of OFDMA to mobile users. Similar to the A2 A communica"on, the power consump"on of the A2G link can be approximated by the user data rate. Power consump"on of the A2G communica"on is formulated as below, $P_{i}^{a 2 g}=P_{0_{i}}+\\Delta_{p} \\cdot \\frac{P_{\\max }^{a 2 g}}{\\lef|U_{i}\\right|} \\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}_{i}} \\min \\lef(\\frac{f_{i u}^{u}}{r_{i u}}, 1\\right), \\quad \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ , where sta"c power consump"on $P_{0_{i}}$ is 6.8 W and $\\Delta_{p}$ is 4 as a mul"plier for load-dependent power consump"on, which is comparable with pico-cell power consump"on [49]. Similarly, the transmission power on each A2G link iu can be scaled by user data rate $f_{i u}$ against link capacity, $r_{i u}$ with bandwidth $B_{i u}$ assigned for the GMU $u$; the access link bandwidth is evenly assigned to the individual user in this study.

                      Document(metadata={'page': 5, 'source': 'paper2_la.pdf-5'}, page_content='The UAV energy consump"on is in general composed of two main components, namely the communica"on related energy and the propulsion energy. The communica"on related energy includes that for communica"on circuitry, signal processing, signal radia"on/recep"on, etc. In this paper, we assume that the communica"on related power is a constant, which is denoted as $P_{c}$ in wat (W). On the other hand, the propulsion energy consump"on is needed to keep the UAV alom and support its movement, if necessary. In general, the propulsion energy depends on the UAV ﬂying speed as well as its accelera"on. In this paper, for the purpose of exposi"on and drawing the essen"al design insight, we ignore the addi"onal energy consump"on caused by UAV accelera"on, which is valid for typical communica"on applica"ons where UAV manoeuvring "me only takes a small por"on of the total opera"on "me. As derived in Appendix A for a rotary-wing UAV ﬂying with speed $V$, the propulsion power consump"on can be modeled as $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P(V)=\\underbrace{P_{0}\\lem(1+\\frac{3 V^{2}}{U_{\\text {"p }}^{2}}\\right)}_{\\text {blade proﬁle }}+\\underbrace{P_{i}\\lem(\\sqrt{1+\\frac{V^{4}}{4 v_{0}^{4}}}-\\frac{V^{2}}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{1 / 2}}_{\\text {induced }}+\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} d_{0} \\rho s A V^{3}}_{\\text {parasite }}, \\tag{6} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $P_{0}$ and $P_{i}$ are two constants deﬁned in (61) of Appendix A represen"ng the blade proﬁle power and induced power in hovering status, respec"vely, $U_{\\text {"p }}$ denotes the "p speed of the rotor blade, $v_{0}$ is known as the mean rotor induced velocity in hover, $d_{0}$ and $s$ are the fuselage drag ra"o and rotor solidity, respec"vely, and $\\rho$ and $A$ denote the air density and rotor disc area, respec"vely. The relevant parameters are explained in details in Table $\\square$ and Appendix A It is observed from (6) that the propulsion power consump"on of rotary-wing UAVs consists of three components: blade proﬁle, induced, and parasite power. The blade proﬁle power and parasite power, which increase quadra"cally and cubically with $V$, respec"vely, are needed to overcome the proﬁle drag of the blades and the fuselage drag, respec"vely. On the other hand, the induced power is that required to overcome the induced drag of the blades, which decreases with $V$.  By subs"tu"ng $V=0$ into (6), we obtain the power consump"on for hovering status as $P_{h}=P_{0}+P_{i}$, which is a ﬁnite value depending on the aircram weight, air density, and rotor disc area, etc. (see (61) in Appendix A for details). As $V$ increases, it can be veriﬁed that $P(V)$ in (6) ﬁrstly decreases and then increases with $V$, i.e., hovering is in general not the most power-conserving status. It can be veriﬁed that the power func"on $P(V)$ in (6) is neither convex nor concave with respect to $V$. It is much more involved compared to the power model for ﬁxed-wing UAV (cf. Equa"on (7) of [25]), which is a convex func"on consis"ng of two simple terms: one increasing cubically and the other decreasing inversely with $V$.  When $V \\gg v_{0}$, by applying the ﬁrst-order Taylor approxima"on $(1+x)^{1 / 2} \\approx 1+\\frac{1}{2} x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$, (6) can be approximated as a convex func"on, i.e., $$ \\begin{equa"on*}')]}
