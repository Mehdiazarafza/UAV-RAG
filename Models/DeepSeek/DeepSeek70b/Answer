Q 1-1 
'result': '<think>\n'
           'Okay, so I need to figure out the elevation angle based on the '
           'given positions of the ground user and the UAV-BS. Let me start by '
           'understanding what an elevation angle is. From what I remember, '
           'the elevation angle in the context of wireless communications or '
           'between two points is the angle between the line connecting the '
           'two points (in this case, the ground user and the UAV) and the '
           "horizontal plane. So it's like looking up from the ground to the "
           'UAV, and the angle your line of sight makes with the horizontal.\n'
           '\n'
           'First, I need to find the distance between these two points in 3D '
           'space because the elevation angle depends on their positions. The '
           'ground user is at (47,23) meters, which I assume is in a 2D plane, '
           'so their z-coordinate is 0. The UAV-BS is at (65,73,15)m, so its x '
           "and y coordinates are 65 and 73 respectively, and it's 15 meters "
           'above the ground.\n'
           '\n'
           'To find the elevation angle, I think I can model this as a right '
           'triangle where the vertical distance from the ground user to the '
           'UAV is one leg (which is 15 meters), and the horizontal distance '
           'between them is the other leg. The hypotenuse would then be the '
           'straight-line distance between the two points in 3D space.\n'
           '\n'
           'So, first step: calculate the horizontal distance between the two '
           'points. Since both are given in x and y coordinates, I can use the '
           'Euclidean distance formula for 2D:\n'
           '\n'
           'Horizontal distance = sqrt[(65 - 47)^2 + (73 - 23)^2]\n'

           '\n'
           '65 - 47 = 18\n'
           '73 - 23 = 50\n'
           '\n'
           'So, horizontal distance = sqrt(18^2 + 50^2) = sqrt(324 + 2500) = '
           'sqrt(2824)\n'
           '\n'
           "Calculating sqrt(2824). Let's see: 53^2 is 2809, so sqrt(2824) is "
           'a bit more than 53. Maybe approximately 53.11 meters.\n'
           '\n'
           'Now, the vertical distance is given as 15 meters.\n'
           '\n'
           'So now I have a right triangle with opposite side (vertical) = 15m '
           'and adjacent side (horizontal) ≈53.11m.\n'

           'The elevation angle θ can be found using the tangent function:\n'
           '\n'
           'tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent = 15 / 53.11\n'
           '\n'
           'Let me compute that: 15 divided by approximately 53.11 is roughly '
           '0.2823.\n'
           '\n'
           'Now, to find θ, I take the arctangent of 0.2823. Using a '
           'calculator, arctan(0.2823) is about 15.7 degrees.\n'
           '\n'
           "Wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's "
           'easy to mix up the sides. The elevation angle is indeed calculated '
           'using tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent, which in this case is '
           'vertical over horizontal distance. So yes, that should be '
           'correct.\n'
           '\n'
           'Alternatively, I could use the sine function since sin(theta) = '
           'opposite / hypotenuse. Let me compute the hypotenuse first:\n'
           '\n'
           'Hypotenuse = sqrt(horizontal^2 + vertical^2) = sqrt(53.11^2 + '

           '\n'
           'sqrt(3049) ≈ 55.22 meters.\n'

           'with my previous calculation using tangent. So both methods give '
           "me around 15.7 to 15.8 degrees, so I can be confident it's "

The idle state is possible in places such as charging sta"ons or building roofops that are assumed available over the search area in this study.  All UAVs ﬂy horizontally at minimum al"tude for energy eﬃciency except "me for landing and take-oﬀ; UAVs consume much energy for propulsion when increasing the al"tude. Low al"tude reduces a projected area as a serving region with narrow Angle of View (AoV), but is advantageous to provide a higher data rate. Addi"onally, the wind speed varies propelling energy according to wind direc"on. In this study, we consider the constant wind speed and ﬂight speed for simplicity. However, we consider energy varia"on by varying air density according to al"tude.  The UAV velocity is varying with its applica"on from several ten meters per second (mps) to several hundred mps. Especially, some military or cri"cal mission-purposed UAVs can ﬂy by more than several hundred mps for several hours or days based on gas, fuel cells, and selfcharging. But in this study, we consider inexpensive commercial UAVs for civil pla[orms that can ﬂy less than 20 mps .  In this study, the serving area is sectorized into sub-regions like the Manha_an grid, where the size of the sub-region is determined according to the search region of the UAV. The individual ﬂight trajectory of each UAV is given by the GCC which predicts GMU loca"ons based on previous par"al observa"ons by the limited number of UAVs.  \\subsec"on*{4.3. UAV wireless communica"ons}  \\subsec"on*{4.3.1. UAV to GMU communica"ons}  There have been many simula"on and measurement studies on the air-to-ground (A2G) channel model [41]. According to the geoloca"ons, the reﬂec"on and diﬀrac"on along ray prora"on can vary. In [42], a sta"s"cal propaga"on model was developed using a ray tracing simulator to predict the A2G path loss from a LAP UAV to a terrestrial device in urban environments, where virtual-city environments like Manha_an are simulated according to ITU-R sta"s"cal parameters at $700 \\mathrm{MHz}, 2000 \\mathrm{MHz}$ and 5800 MHz , with eleva"on angles above 15 degrees.  In this study, ultra-low al"tude A2G communica"ons are assumed for urban environments where various structures and buildings are deployed to provide probabilis"cally LOS or Non-LOS (NLOS) from UAVs. The sta"s"c model of the LOS between the UAVs and GMUs is modeled as a logis"c func"on with eleva"on angle in [13] as below,'),

           'Okay, so I need to compute the blade power of a UAV in forward '

           '- The constant value p0 is 1.5.\n'
           '- The forward speed v is 110 km/h.\n'
           '- The blade angular velocity is 300 radians per second.\n'
           '- The rotor radius is 0.4 meters.\n'
           '\n'
           'Hmm, first, I should probably convert the units to make sure '
           'everything is consistent. The forward speed is given in kilometers '
           'per hour, but I think I need it in meters per second for '
           'calculations involving the rotor. Let me do that conversion.\n'
           '\n'
           'So, 110 km/h is equal to 110,000 meters per hour. There are 3600 '
           'seconds in an hour, so dividing 110,000 by 3600 gives '
           'approximately 30.5556 m/s. That seems a bit high because typical '
           "UAV forward speeds might be lower, but maybe it's correct.\n"
           '\n'
           'Next, the blade angular velocity is given as 300 rad/s. The rotor '
           'radius is 0.4 meters. I think power in such cases can be '

           'Alternatively, another approach could be to calculate the power '
           'required based on the rotational speed and the torque. Power in '
           'rotational systems is typically given by P = τ * ω, where τ is '
           'torque and ω is angular velocity.\n'
           '\n'
           "But I don't have the torque value here. Maybe I can derive it from "
           'other parameters. Torque can be calculated if we know the thrust '
           'force because τ = F * r, where F is the thrust force and r is the '
           'radius.\n'
           '\n'
           'However, without knowing the thrust, this might not be '

           '\n'
           'Wait, perhaps using the given p0 value as a constant multiplier in '

The communica"on related energy includes that for communica"on circuitry, signal processing, signal radia"on/recep"on, etc. In this paper, we assume that the communica"on related power is a constant, which is denoted as $P_{c}$ in wat (W). On the other hand, the propulsion energy consump"on is needed to keep the UAV alom and support its movement, if necessary. In general, the propulsion energy depends on the UAV ﬂying speed as well as its accelera"on. In this paper, for the purpose of exposi"on and drawing the essen"al design insight, we ignore the addi"onal energy consump"on caused by UAV accelera"on, which is valid for typical communica"on applica"ons where UAV manoeuvring "me only takes a small por"on of the total opera"on "me. As derived in Appendix A for a rotary-wing UAV ﬂying with speed $V$, the propulsion power consump"on can be modeled as $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P(V)=\\underbrace{P_{0}\\lem(1+\\frac{3 V^{2}}{U_{\\text {"p }}^{2}}\\right)}_{\\text {blade proﬁle }}+\\underbrace{P_{i}\\lem(\\sqrt{1+\\frac{V^{4}}{4 v_{0}^{4}}}-\\frac{V^{2}}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{1 / 2}}_{\\text {induced }}+\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} d_{0} \\rho s A V^{3}}_{\\text {parasite }}, \\tag{6} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $P_{0}$ and $P_{i}$ are two constants deﬁned in (61) of Appendix A represen"ng the blade proﬁle power and induced power in hovering status, respec"vely, $U_{\\text {"p }}$ denotes the "p speed of the rotor blade, $v_{0}$ is known as the mean rotor induced velocity in hover, $d_{0}$ and $s$ are the fuselage drag ra"o and rotor solidity, respec"vely, and $\\rho$ and $A$ denote the air density and rotor disc area, respec"vely. The relevant parameters are explained in details in Table $\\square$ and Appendix A It is observed from (6) that the propulsion power consump"on of rotary-wing UAVs consists of three components: blade proﬁle, induced, and parasite power. The blade proﬁle power and parasite power, which increase quadra"cally and cubically with $V$, respec"vely, are needed to overcome the proﬁle drag of the blades and the fuselage drag, respec"vely. On the other hand, the induced power is that required to overcome the induced drag of the blades, which decreases with $V$.  By subs"tu"ng $V=0$ into (6), we obtain the power consump"on for hovering status as $P_{h}=P_{0}+P_{i}$, which is a ﬁnite value depending on the aircram weight, air density, and rotor disc area, etc. (see (61) in Appendix A for details). As $V$ increases, it can be veriﬁed that $P(V)$ in (6) ﬁrstly decreases and then increases with $V$, i.e., hovering is in general not the most power-conserving status. It can be veriﬁed that the power func"on $P(V)$ in (6) is neither convex nor concave with respect to $V$. It is much more involved compared to the power model for ﬁxed-wing UAV (cf. Equa"on (7) of [25]), which is a convex func"on consis"ng of two simple terms: one increasing cubically and the other decreasing inversely with $V$.  When $V \\gg v_{0}$, by applying the ﬁrst-order Taylor approxima"on $(1+x)^{1 / 2} \\approx 1+\\frac{1}{2} x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$, (6) can be approximated as a convex func"on, i.e., $$ \\begin{equa"on*}'),

However, the above results for ﬁxed-wing UAVs cannot be applied for rotary-wing UAVs, due to their fundamentally diﬀerent mechanical designs and hence dras"cally diﬀerent propulsion energy models. This thus mo"vates our current work to inves"gate energy-eﬃcient communica"on for rotary-wing UAVs.  In this paper, we study a wireless communica"on system enabled a rotary-wing UAV. Compared to ﬁxed-wing UAVs, rotary-wing UAVs have several appealing advantages such as the ability to take oﬀ and land ver"cally, as well as for hovering, which render them more popular in the current UAV market. We consider the scenario where a rotary-wing UAV is dispatched as a ﬂying AP to communicate with mul"ple GNs, each of which has a target number of informa"on bits to be transmited/received to/from the UAV. Such a setup corresponds to many prac"cal applica"ons, such as UAV-enabled data collec"on for periodic sensing, UAV-enabled caching where the UAV pre-fetches the data and then transmits to the designated caching nodes [32], etc. Our objec"ve is to minimize the UAV\'s energy consump"on, including both propulsion energy and communica"on energy, while ensuring that the communica"on requirement for each GN is sa"sﬁed. The main contribu"ons of this paper are summarized as follows.  First, we derive an analy"cal model for the propulsion power consump"on of rotary-wing UAVs, based on the results in aircram literature [33], [34]. As expected, the obtained model is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that for ﬁxed-wing UAVs derived in our prior work [25].  Based on the derived power consump"on model, we formulate the energy minimiza"on problem that jointly op"mizes the UAV trajectory, the communica"on "me alloca"on among the mul"ple GNs, as well as the total mission comple"on "me. The problem is diﬃcult to be op"mally solved, as it is non-convex and cons"tutes inﬁnite number of op"miza"on variables that are coupled in con"nuous func"ons over "me. To tackle this problem, we ﬁrst consider the simple ﬂy-hover-communicate design [17] to gain useful insights. Under this design, the UAV successively visits a set of op"mized hovering loca"ons, and communicates with each of the GNs only when hovering at the corresponding loca"on. In this case, the problem reduces to ﬁnding the op"mal hovering loca"ons and hovering dura"on at each loca"on, as well as the visi"ng order and ﬂying speed among these loca"ons. The problem is s"ll NP hard, as it includes the classic NP hard travelling salesman problem (TSP) as a special case [35]. By leveraging the exis"ng TSP-solving algorithm [36] and convex op"miza"on techniques, an eﬃcient high-quality approximate solu"on is obtained for our problem.  Next, we propose a general solu"on to the energy minimiza"on problem where the UAV communicates also when ﬂying. To this end, we ﬁrst propose a novel discre"za"on technique, called path discre"za"on, to transform the original problem with inﬁnitely many variables into a more tractable form with a ﬁnite number of variables. Diﬀerent from the widely used "me discre"za"on approach for UAV trajectory design (see e.g. [23] and [25]), path discre"za"on does not require the mission comple"on "me to be pre-speciﬁed. This is par"cularly useful for problems where the mission comple"on "me is also one of the op"miza"on variables, as for the energy minimiza"on problem studied in this paper. However, the path-discre"zed problem is s"ll non-convex, and thus it is challenging to ﬁnd its op"mal solu"on. By u"lizing the successive convex approxima"on (SCA) technique [23], an eﬃcient itera"ve algorithm is proposed to simultaneously update the UAV trajectory and')]}

           'latency for the tasks on the UAV side based on the given '

           '\n'
           "- CPU resources allocated by the UAV server to vehicle k's "
           'computational tasks (f_uk): 2.75 GHz\n'
           '- Ratio of vehicles’ computational tasks processed by servers at '
           'UAV side (θ_uk): 0.68\n'
           '- Calculation task parameter D_k: 1.5 Mbit\n'
           '- Total CPU cycles required to process the computational tasks for '
           'vehicle k (Ck): 1000 cycles/bit\n'
           '\n'
           'Alright, so I need to find the latency, which is the time it takes '
           'to process these tasks on the UAV.\n'
           '\n'
           'First, let me understand each term:\n'
           '\n'
           "1. **f_uk**: This is the processing speed of the UAV's CPU. It's "
           'given in GHz, which stands for gigahertz, or 10^9 cycles per '
           'second. So 2.75 GHz means the UAV can perform 2.75 billion cycles '
           'every second.\n'
           '\n'
           '2. **θ_uk**: This is the ratio of tasks that are processed by the '
           "UAV. Since it's a ratio, I think this means that out of all the "
           'computational tasks from vehicle k, 68% (0.68) are handled by the '
           'UAV, and the rest might be offloaded elsewhere.\n'
           '\n'
           "3. **D_k**: The size of the task data is 1.5 Mbit. That's "
           'megabits, so 10^6 bits.\n'
           '\n'
           '4. **Ck**: Each bit requires 1000 CPU cycles to process. So for '
           'each bit in D_k, the UAV needs to perform 1000 cycles.\n'
           '\n'
           'Now, I need to compute the latency. Latency here would be the time '
           'taken by the UAV to process its share of the computational tasks.\n'
           '\n'
           'Let me break it down step by step:\n'
           '\n'
           '1. **Total Task Size**: The total data size is D_k = 1.5 Mbit. '
           'Since θ_uk is the ratio processed by the UAV, I need to find out '
           'how much data that is.\n'
           '\n'
           '   So, the amount of data processed by the UAV would be θ_uk * D_k '
           '= 0.68 * 1.5 Mbit.\n'
           '\n'
           '2. **Convert Data Size to Bits**: Since D_k is in megabits and Ck '
           'is per bit, I can keep it as bits for now. But let me compute θ_uk '
           '* D_k:\n'
           '\n'
           '   0.68 * 1.5 = 1.02 Mbit. So the UAV processes 1.02 million '
           'bits.\n'
           '\n'
           '3. **Total CPU Cycles Needed**: Each bit requires 1000 cycles, so '
           'total cycles needed are Ck * (θ_uk * D_k) in bits.\n'
           '\n'
           '   That would be 1000 cycles/bit * 1.02 * 10^6 bits = 1.02 * 10^9 '
           'cycles.\n'
           '\n'

           '10^9 cycles per second.\n'
           '\n'
           '5. **Compute Time (Latency)**: Time is equal to the number of '
           'cycles divided by the CPU speed.\n'
           '\n'

           '\n'
           '   1.02 / 2.75 ≈ 0.3701818 seconds.\n'
           '\n'
           '   To convert this into milliseconds, since 1 second is 1000 ms, '
           'it would be approximately 370.1818 ms.\n'
           '\n'
           "Wait a minute, let me double-check the units to make sure I didn't "
           'mix anything up.\n'
           '\n'
           '- D_k is in Mbit (megabits), which is 10^6 bits.\n'
           '- θ_uk is unitless, so multiplying by D_k gives us bits processed '
           'by UAV: correct.\n'
           '- Ck is cycles per bit, so total cycles are indeed 1000 * 1.02e6 = '
           '1.02e9 cycles.\n'
           '- CPU speed is in GHz, which is cycles per second, so dividing '
           'cycles by speed gives seconds.\n'
           '\n'
           'Yes, that seems right. So the latency should be approximately '
           '0.370 seconds or 370 ms.\n'
           '\n'
           "I think I've covered all steps without missing anything. Let me "
           'just write it out clearly:\n'

           '1. Compute data processed by UAV: θ_uk * D_k = 0.68 * 1.5 Mbit = '
           '1.02 Mbit.\n'
           '2. Convert to bits: 1.02e6 bits.\n'
           '3. Total cycles needed: 1000 cycles/bit * 1.02e6 bits = 1.02e9 '

           '\n'
           'Yes, that makes sense. So the computational latency is about 0.37 '

The transmission latency between the UAV and the RSU can be calculated as $$ \\begin{equa5on*} t_{i}^{u k}=\\frac{\\theta_{k}^{i} D_{k}}{r_{i}^{u}} \\tag{7} \\end{equa5on*} $$  \\sec5on*{B. COMPUTATION MODEL}  We assume that processing is performed on the server of the UAV or RSU only when the task data transfer is completed. Moreover, by performing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), the server is able to dynamically allocate its computa5onal resources based on the type or number of tasks arriving [21]. Let $f_{k}^{u}$ denote the CPU resources allocated by the UAV server to the vehicle $k$ computa5onal tasks and $F^{U A V}$ denote the total CPU computa5onal resources of the UAV. Thus we can obtain the computa5onal latency and computa5onal resource constraints for the tasks on the UAV side $$ \\begin{align*} t_{c p}^{u k} & =\\frac{\\theta_{k}^{u} D_{k} C_{k}}{f_{k}^{u}}  \\tag{8}\\\\ \\sum_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}^{u} & \\leq F^{U A V} \\tag{9} \\end{align*} $$  When the data from the UAV oﬄoad is received, the RSU starts the computa5onal processing process. Compared to UAV, RSU have larger computa5onal resources. Therefore, the alloca5on of RSU computa5onal resources will dominate the comple5on delay of vehicle-aware computa5onal tasks. This also means that the proper alloca5on of computa5onal resources to RSU will directly aﬀect the judgment decision of vehicle percep5on. Thus we use hierarchical analysis (AHP) [22] to analyze the priority weight of each vehicle's data fusion task among all data fusion tasks at the current phase. Then, the computa5onal resources of the RSU are allocated according to the priority weights so as to meet the diﬀeren5ated demands of diﬀerent vehicles' computa5onal tasks. First, we construct the hierarchical model with the priority weight of the vehicle, the calcula5on task parameters $S_{k}, D_{k}, C_{k}$ and the vehicle $k$ as the target layer, the criterion layer and the solu5on layer, respec5vely. Then, according to the hierarchical model, the judgment matrix $A=\\let(a_{i j}\\right)_{n * n}$ for each layer other than the target layer is constructed, where $$ a_{i j}=\\let\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{1}{a_{i j}}=\\text { rho, rho }=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}  \\tag{10}\\\\ 1, i=j . \\end{array}\\right. $$"),

The rela5onship between bandwidth resources and system cost under diﬀerent schemes. vehicle uploading data to the UAV, which leads to a decrease in the system cost. Clearly, despite the increasing bandwidth resources, the system cost of the Only-UAV scheme is much higher than the other schemes. This is because each vehicle will receive signiﬁcantly fewer computa5onal resources if the vehicle only chooses to oﬄoad tasks to the UAV for processing where computa5onal resources are limited. Since computa5onal resources are propor5onal to processing latency, the reduc5on in computa5onal resources will result in a larger system cost. In addi5on, we can see from the ﬁgure that the Base-Priority-UAV-RSU scheme proposed in this paper has the smallest system cost. Compared with the Only-UAV scheme and the Only-RSU scheme, the Base-Priority-UAV-RSU scheme can oﬄoad tasks to both UAV and RSU for parallel processing, so the task processing latency is greatly reduced, which results in a smaller system cost. Compared with the No-Priority-UAV-RSU scheme, the RSU in the Base-Priority-UAV-RSU scheme no longer divides the compu5ng resources equally among the vehicle compu5ng tasks, but allocates the resources dynamically according to the real-5me demand of the compu5ng tasks, so the system cost is smaller. Fig. 4 represents the rela5onship between the total compu5ng resources (compu5ng power) of the UAV and the system cost. It is obvious in Fig. 4 that the system cost of the UAV-only solu5on decreases rapidly when the UAV compu5ng resources gradually increase un5l 20 GHz . This is because, under this policy, all users oﬄoad their compu5ng tasks to the UAV and are processed by the UAV only. And as the UAV compu5ng resources increase, the processing latency of each task con5nues to decrease. As the UAV compu5ng resources increase to 20 GHz , the rate of system cost reduc5on for the UAV-only scheme gradually moderates and overlaps with the priority-based and priority-free scheme. This is because as the computa5onal resources consumed increase, although the processing latency decreases, ![](hwps://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_10_589f7542226307ce7cddg-08.jpg?height=629&width=811&top_let_y=194&top_let_x=143)  FIGURE 4.

The amount of data processed by each server under diﬀerent total amounts of data. the UAV processing energy consump5on gradually increases, which eventually aﬀects the system cost to converge to a balance. In the RSU-only scenario, the UAV only acts as a forwarding relay to assist the user in oﬄoading all compu5ng tasks to the RSU server side for processing. Therefore the increase in UAV compu5ng resources does not aﬀect the system cost of this scheme. From the ﬁgure we can see that the two curves of the proposed scheme in this paper and the no-priority scheme nearly overlap. When the UAV compu5ng resources increase, the amount of data processed at the UAV side increases and the amount of data processed at the RSU server side decreases. Therefore, the alloca5on of compu5ng resources by priority at the RSU server side has a smaller impact on the system cost, resul5ng in a near overlap of these two curves.'),

Rela5onship between computa5onal resources obtained for data of diﬀerent security levels and total computa5onal resources of RSU1. the UAV and 4 servers on the ground RSU side for processing. Fig. 5 represents the rela5onship between the amount of data processed on the server side for diﬀerent RSU with diﬀerent total amount of task data. As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the amount of data processed on the server side oﬄoaded to the RSU is much larger than the amount of data processed oﬄoaded to the UAV. Although the amount of data processed by each server has been increasing as the total amount of data to be processed has been increasing, the rate of increase in the amount of data processed by the servers at UAV and each RSU has been generally consistent. From this, we can conclude that when the resources are certain, the total amount of data processed by the server at the RSU side is much more than the total amount of data processed at the UAV side, i.e., the server processing delay at the RSU side has a greater impact on the system cost.  Fig. 6 represents the computa5onal resources allocated to diﬀerent levels of computa5onal tasks as the computa5onal resources of the server at RSU1 increase. When the compu5ng resources of the server of RSU1 are less, the diﬀerence in compu5ng resources available for all compu5ng tasks are smaller. When the compu5ng resources of the server of RSU1 increase, the compu5ng resources allocated to diﬀerent levels of compu5ng tasks also gradually increase. Moreover, the gap in computa5onal resources between the computa5onal tasks assigned to higher-level computa5onal tasks and lower-level computa5onal tasks gradually increases. This is because diﬀerent levels of compu5ng tasks aﬀect the priority coeﬃcient of compu5ng resource alloca5on. The higher the computa5onal rank, the higher the priority weight, and the more computa5onal resources are available. Therefore, the SCA-based priority resource alloca5on scheme proposed in this paper is able to dynamically divide the compu5ng resources of the system according to the diﬀeren5al user requirements.  \\sec5on*{VI. CONCLUSION}  This paper proposes an energy-eﬃcient computa5on oﬄoading strategy for mul5ple sensor data fusion in UAV Aided V2X Network supported by Integrated Sensing and Communica5on. We priori5ze the data fusion tasks according to their importance, and minimize UAV energy consump5on and data fusion task processing delay by jointly op5mizing the oﬄoad decision and the compu5ng resources of UAV and MEC. Since the joint op5miza5on formula5on problem is complex and non-convex, this paper proposes an op5miza5on algorithm based on SCA. The algorithm transforms the above op5miza5on problem into an approximate convex problem and then obtains the op5mal solu5on through successive itera5ve. Simula5on results show that the proposed strategy's performance is bewer than the baseline strategys in terms of reducing the UAV energy consump5on and the weighted sum of data fusion task delay. In future work, we will fully exploit the"),

The ﬁrst phase ends when the UAV receives all the task data from the vehicle $k$.  Similar to the literature [17], we assume that there is complete granularity in the computa5onal task data par55on and the vehicle computa5onal task data can be divided into arbitrary propor5ons for oﬄoading. Therefore, in the second stage we use a par5al oﬄoading model where the UAV is able to divide the computa5onal tasks of vehicle $k$ into ﬁve parts. the UAV processes a part locally and forwards the remaining part to the ground RSUs for processing via relay.  Finally, in the third stage, the ground base sta5on performs priority weight calcula5on for some of the tasks received from vehicle $k$ and allocates computa5onal resources for processing according to the priority weight. In most computa5onally intensive applica5ons, such as face recogni5on and video analysis, the delay and energy consump5on required to process the results of the computa5onal tasks back to the vehicle side is much smaller than the delay and energy consump5on of the oﬄoading of the vehicle computa5onal tasks, so we ignore them [18].  \\sec5on*{A. COMMUNICATION MODEL}  When the UAV ﬂies at a certain al5tude to communicate with the vehicle, the communica5on channel between the UAV and the vehicle $k$ and the RSUs is dominated by the line of sight transmission (LoS) link [19], so the channel between the UAV and the vehicle and the channel between the UAV and the RSUs uses a free-space path loss model. The channel gain between the vehicle and the UAV is expressed as $$ \\begin{equa5on*} h_{k}^{u} \\triangleq \\alpha_{0}\\let(d_{k}^{u}\\right)^{-2}=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{H^{2}+\\let\\|q^{u}-q^{k}\\right\\|^{2}} \\tag{1} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $\\alpha_{0}$ denotes the received power when the reference distance is 1 m and the transmission power is $1 W, d_{k}^{u}$ denotes the transmission distance between the mobile user and the UAV, and $\\|x\\|$ denotes he Euclidean parametriza5on of the vector. Similarly, the link gain from the UAV to the ground RSUi can be expressed as $$ \\begin{equa5on*} h_{i}^{u} \\triangleq \\alpha_{0}\\let(d_{i}^{u}\\right)^{-2}=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{H^{2}+\\let\\|q^{u}-q^{i}\\right\\|^{2}}, \\tag{2} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $d_{i}^{u}$ denotes the downlink transmission distance from the UAV to RSUi.  To eliminate the signal interference between the vehicles and to simplify the system model, the frequency division mul5ple access (OFDMA) technique is used for data transmission between the UAV and the vehicle.

Note that the achievable data rate of an FSO link es"mated by (5) does not consider the poin"ng loss owing to the fact that various technologies, such as highaccuracy Acquisi"on, Tracking, and Poin"ng (ATP) systems [42], [43] and adap"ve probabilis"c constella"on shaping [44], have been proposed to signiﬁcantly mi"gate the poin"ng loss. However, a more sophis"cated model [45], which takes both poin"ng loss and atmospheric turbulence into considera"on, can be applied to es"mate the achievable data rate of an FSO link.

Coverage probability, transmit power, and throughput analysis}  In this sec"on, closed-form expressions for ﬁnding the coverage probability, minimum transmit power required to maintain the same coverage probability at the OHP using the LS, and the throughput are derived using stochas"c geometry. The results obtained from these closed-form expressions are then compared with those obtained using simula"ons in sec"on 5.5 in order to ascertain their validity.  \\subsec"on*{4.1. Coverage probability analysis}  The UAV network is assumed not to receive interference from other BSs. Thus, the coverage probability can be expressed as: $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\lambda)=\\mathbb{P}(\\Gamma>\\lambda)$, where $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is probability that $\\Gamma>\\lambda$ over the en"re circular area with radius $R$ centered at the origin, $O$. $\\lambda$ represents the minimum threshold value of signal to noise ra"o $(\\Gamma)$ that is required for reliable communica"on.  For a given distance $R_{i}$ from the UAV posi"on to UE, the $\\Gamma$ is given as $\\Gamma_{i}=\\frac{D_{o}\\leM(\\frac{R_{0}}{R_{i}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\cdot\\leM(H_{i}\\right)^{2} \\cdot P}{N}$, where $D_{0}$ represents the fading power gains from a typical UE to the UAV, $R_{i}$ is the distance from the UAV loca"on to a typical UE which is given as $R_{i}=\\sqrt{h^{2}+\\Delta^{2}+v^{2}-2 \\Delta v \\cos \\theta}$ and $N$ is the system noise, and $P$ is the transmi?ed power.

From Fig. 5, it can be clearly observed that the total power consump"on of the UAV-BS with LS increases as $\\Delta$ increases. This increase in the total power consump"on is driven by the transmit power increase to maintain the QoS. However, with the increase in the value of $\\Delta$ from 0 to 400 m , the total power consump"on of the UAV-BS with LS at 400 m is s"ll about one-third that of the UAV-BS with OHP .  However, it must be noted that even though it is possible to con"nue increasing the transmit power in order to maintain the QoS, the extent to which the transmit power can be increased is limited by restric"on put in place by regulatory bodies and this ul"mately limits the maximum distance that the LS can be situated from the OHP in real network deployments.  \\sec"on*{6. Conclusion}  In this sec"on, the eﬀect of u"lizing LSs on UAV energy consump"on, coverage probability and throughput performance was inves"gated. A closed-form expression for each metric was ﬁrst derived and validated using Monte Carlo simula"ons. Analy"cal and simula"on results revealed that the distance between the LS and the OHP is inversely related to both the coverage probability and system throughput. However, the magnitude of performance reduc"on depends on the transmission frequency u"lized. It was shown that the performance of the network can be maintained with the LS approach as in the OHP approach by adjus"ng the transmit power of the UAV-BS. Therefore, network providers can signiﬁcantly reduce the energy consump"on involved in exploi"ng UAVs for wireless communica"ons by ﬁrst examining the service requirements of users and the frequency band involved, then the analy"cal solu"ons developed in this work can be used to determine the best loca"ons for the LSs as well as the transmit power oﬀset required to maintain the QoS of the UEs.  \\sec"on*{Declara"on of compe"ng interest}  The authors declare the following ﬁnancial interests/personal rela"onships which may be considered as poten"al compe"ng interests: A?ai Abubakar reports ﬁnancial support was provided by Ter"ary Educa"on Trust Fund.

It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission. Aggrega#ng all the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network together yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} P=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}_{i}}\\le{[p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)+p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)\\right] f(x, y) d x d y \\tag{11} \\end{equa#on*} $$ which is obtained by taking the integral over the distribu#on on all areas $\\mathcal{A}_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$. Based on the above modeling, the op#miza#on problem ﬁnding UAVs' deployment loca#on and associa#on to minimize the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network can be formulated as $$ \\begin{align*} & \\mathcal{P} 1: \\text { Given : } \\beta, N, M, f(x, y), \\mathcal{A}, b_{1}, b_{2}, K_{o}, B_{u}, B_{v}, \\sigma_{u}^{2}, \\sigma_{v}^{2} \\\\ & \\text { Find : } \\Omega, l_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N} \\\\"),

To proceed, how deployment and associa#on aﬀect the power consump#on of the ground users and UAVs should be described ﬁrstly.  To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$. From (5), it can be observed that $p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)$ is mainly determined by $d_{i}^{2}(x, y)$. Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is.

Thus, the coverage probability can be expressed as: $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\lambda)=\\mathbb{P}(\\Gamma>\\lambda)$, where $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is probability that $\\Gamma>\\lambda$ over the en"re circular area with radius $R$ centered at the origin, $O$. $\\lambda$ represents the minimum threshold value of signal to noise ra"o $(\\Gamma)$ that is required for reliable communica"on.  For a given distance $R_{i}$ from the UAV posi"on to UE, the $\\Gamma$ is given as $\\Gamma_{i}=\\frac{D_{o}\\leM(\\frac{R_{0}}{R_{i}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\cdot\\leM(H_{i}\\right)^{2} \\cdot P}{N}$, where $D_{0}$ represents the fading power gains from a typical UE to the UAV, $R_{i}$ is the distance from the UAV loca"on to a typical UE which is given as $R_{i}=\\sqrt{h^{2}+\\Delta^{2}+v^{2}-2 \\Delta v \\cos \\theta}$ and $N$ is the system noise, and $P$ is the transmi?ed power.

To proceed, how deployment and associa#on aﬀect the power consump#on of the ground users and UAVs should be described ﬁrstly.  To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$.

Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is. Therefore, the transmit power of the ground users will be op#mized through designing UAVs' deployment and associa#on in the following sec#on.  For UAV-base sta#on transmission, UAV $i$ at loca#on $l_{i}$ will collect all the ground users' data in cell $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and forward them to the remote base sta#on at $\\le{(x_{0}, y_{0}, h_{b}\\right)$.

Q 2-2
'result': '<think>\n'
           'Okay, so I need to compute the induced power of a UAV in forward '
           'flight based on the given information. Let me see what data I '
           'have:\n'
           '\n'

           'yet.\n'
           "- Forward speed v is 110 km/h. That's pretty fast for a UAV, but "
           'okay.\n'
           '- Mean rotor induced velocity in hover is 4.03 m/s.\n'
           '\n'
           'I remember that induced power is related to the power required to '
           'generate lift and overcome drag. In forward flight, the induced '

           'First, I should probably convert all units to be consistent. The '

           "just the hover value; it's affected by the forward speed. The "

The communica"on related energy includes that for communica"on circuitry, signal processing, signal radia"on/recep"on, etc. In this paper, we assume that the communica"on related power is a constant, which is denoted as $P_{c}$ in wat (W). On the other hand, the propulsion energy consump"on is needed to keep the UAV alom and support its movement, if necessary. In general, the propulsion energy depends on the UAV ﬂying speed as well as its accelera"on. In this paper, for the purpose of exposi"on and drawing the essen"al design insight, we ignore the addi"onal energy consump"on caused by UAV accelera"on, which is valid for typical communica"on applica"ons where UAV manoeuvring "me only takes a small por"on of the total opera"on "me. As derived in Appendix A for a rotary-wing UAV ﬂying with speed $V$, the propulsion power consump"on can be modeled as $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P(V)=\\underbrace{P_{0}\\lem(1+\\frac{3 V^{2}}{U_{\\text {"p }}^{2}}\\right)}_{\\text {blade proﬁle }}+\\underbrace{P_{i}\\lem(\\sqrt{1+\\frac{V^{4}}{4 v_{0}^{4}}}-\\frac{V^{2}}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{1 / 2}}_{\\text {induced }}+\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} d_{0} \\rho s A V^{3}}_{\\text {parasite }}, \\tag{6} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $P_{0}$ and $P_{i}$ are two constants deﬁned in (61) of Appendix A represen"ng the blade proﬁle power and induced power in hovering status, respec"vely, $U_{\\text {"p }}$ denotes the "p speed of the rotor blade, $v_{0}$ is known as the mean rotor induced velocity in hover, $d_{0}$ and $s$ are the fuselage drag ra"o and rotor solidity, respec"vely, and $\\rho$ and $A$ denote the air density and rotor disc area, respec"vely. The relevant parameters are explained in details in Table $\\square$ and Appendix A It is observed from (6) that the propulsion power consump"on of rotary-wing UAVs consists of three components: blade proﬁle, induced, and parasite power. The blade proﬁle power and parasite power, which increase quadra"cally and cubically with $V$, respec"vely, are needed to overcome the proﬁle drag of the blades and the fuselage drag, respec"vely. On the other hand, the induced power is that required to overcome the induced drag of the blades, which decreases with $V$.  By subs"tu"ng $V=0$ into (6), we obtain the power consump"on for hovering status as $P_{h}=P_{0}+P_{i}$, which is a ﬁnite value depending on the aircram weight, air density, and rotor disc area, etc. (see (61) in Appendix A for details). As $V$ increases, it can be veriﬁed that $P(V)$ in (6) ﬁrstly decreases and then increases with $V$, i.e., hovering is in general not the most power-conserving status. It can be veriﬁed that the power func"on $P(V)$ in (6) is neither convex nor concave with respect to $V$. It is much more involved compared to the power model for ﬁxed-wing UAV (cf. Equa"on (7) of [25]), which is a convex func"on consis"ng of two simple terms: one increasing cubically and the other decreasing inversely with $V$.  When $V \\gg v_{0}$, by applying the ﬁrst-order Taylor approxima"on $(1+x)^{1 / 2} \\approx 1+\\frac{1}{2} x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$, (6) can be approximated as a convex func"on, i.e., $$ \\begin{equa"on*}'),

It can be shown that for any given thrust $T$ or $\\kappa, v_{i 0}$ is a decreasing func"on of $V$.

To obtain a more explicit expression of the required power in (66), we need to determine the rotor thrust $T$ or the thrust-to-weight ra"o $\\kappa$. Fig. 7 shows simpliﬁed schema"cs of the longitudinal forces ac"ng on the aircram in straight level ﬂight (see also Figure 13.2 of [34]), which include the following forces: (i) $T$ : rotor thrust, normal to the disc plane and directed upward; (ii) $D$ : drag of fuselage, which is in the opposite direc"on of the aircram velocity; and (iii) $W$ : the aircram weight. Due to the balance of forces in ver"cal direc"on, we have $T \\cos \\alpha_{T}=W$, where $\\alpha_{T}$ is the "lt angle of the rotor disc. Note that in prac"ce, $\\alpha_{T}$ is usually very small, so we have $T \\approx W$ or $\\kappa \\approx 1$ (see also Equa"on (4.3) of [33]). As a result, the expression in (66) reduces to (6) shown in Sec"on II-B.  \\sec"on*{REFERENCES} [1] S.

Communica"on energy consump"on}  For power consump"on for communica"on, UAVs use transmission power according to data rate. For instance, Soekris device consumes measured energy like 1.58 and 1.14 W as $P_{t x}$ and $P_{r x}$, respec"vely for 48 Mbps data rate with MCS 64-QAM $2 / 3$ [48]. Therefore, energy consump"on on A2 A and A2G links is varying with user traﬃc on them.  Power consump"on of an inter-UAV link $i j$ for the A2 A communica"ons consists of sta"c power consump"on of an ac"ve transceiver, $P_{0_{i}}=3.5 \\mathrm{~W}$ and dynamic power consump"on loaded by the amount of user data rate, $P_{i j}^{a 2 a}=P_{0_{i}}+P_{\\max }^{a 2 a} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}} f_{i j}^{u}}{r_{i j}^{\\max }}$ , where dynamic power consump"on of a A2 A link, $i j$ can be derived by propor"onal transmission power to maximum value $P_{\\max }^{a 2 a}$, which is traﬃc load on the A2 A link, i.e., aggregated user data rate, $\\sum_{u} f_{i j}^{u}$ over achievable data rate $r_{i j}^{\\max }$.  The total power consump"on of each UAV $i$ for A2 A links is $P_{i}^{a 2 a}=\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}} P_{i j}^{a 2 a}$ For A2G communica"on, an UAV as an air base sta"on provides sub-channels of OFDMA to mobile users. Similar to the A2 A communica"on, the power consump"on of the A2G link can be approximated by the user data rate. Power consump"on of the A2G communica"on is formulated as below, $P_{i}^{a 2 g}=P_{0_{i}}+\\Delta_{p} \\cdot \\frac{P_{\\max }^{a 2 g}}{\\lef|U_{i}\\right|} \\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}_{i}} \\min \\lef(\\frac{f_{i u}^{u}}{r_{i u}}, 1\\right), \\quad \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ , where sta"c power consump"on $P_{0_{i}}$ is 6.8 W and $\\Delta_{p}$ is 4 as a mul"plier for load-dependent power consump"on, which is comparable with pico-cell power consump"on [49]. Similarly, the transmission power on each A2G link iu can be scaled by user data rate $f_{i u}$ against link capacity, $r_{i u}$ with bandwidth $B_{i u}$ assigned for the GMU $u$; the access link bandwidth is evenly assigned to the individual user in this study.

ME speed: By deﬁni"on, the ME speed $V_{\\mathrm{me}}$ is the op"mal UAV speed that maximizes the UAV endurance under any given onboard energy $E$.

We use $B^{U A V}$ to denote the bandwidth resources that can be allocated by the UAV, so $B_{k}^{u}$ is limited by $B^{U A V}$ and the number of vehicles $K$ $$ \\begin{equa5on*} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} B_{k}^{u} \\leq B^{U A V} \\tag{4} \\end{equa5on*} $$  Consistent with what was men5oned above, all vehicles oﬄoad computa5onal tasks to the UAV. The transmission delay of vehicle $k$ transmipng data to the UAV is related to the uplink transmission rate and can be expressed as $$ \\begin{equa5on*} t_{k}^{u}=\\frac{D_{k}}{r_{k}^{u}} . \\tag{5} \\end{equa5on*} $$  For simplicity, we consider that the noise power at the UAV and at the RSU is the same [20]. However, it is also very easy to scale when the noise power spectral density between the two is diﬀerent. Therefore, the downlink transmission rate between UAV and RSUi can be calculated as $$ \\begin{equa5on*} r_{i}^{u}=B_{i}^{u} \\log _{2}\\let(1+\\frac{h_{i}^{u} P^{u T}}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\tag{6} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $B_{i}^{u}$ denotes the transmission bandwidth between the RSU and the UAV, $P^{u T}$ is the transmit power of the UAV.

Thus, the transmit power for UAV $i$ to deliver one user's data to the base sta#on can be averagely computed as $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{p_{i}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)}{M a_{i}} \\tag{9} \\end{equa#on*} $$  Subs#tu#ng (4) and (6)-(8) into (9) yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{\\le{(2^{M a_{i} r_{u} / B_{v}}-1\\right) \\sigma_{v}^{2} K_{o} d_{i 0}^{2}}{M a_{i}} \\tag{10} \\end{equa#on*} $$  From (10), it is observed that the required transmit power for each UAV to relay data of one user depends not only on the UAV's posi#on $l_{i}$ (related to given deployment scheme) but also the user ra#o $a_{i}$ (related to associa#on scheme). It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission. Aggrega#ng all the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network together yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} P=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}_{i}}\\le{[p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)+p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)\\right] f(x, y) d x d y \\tag{11} \\end{equa#on*} $$ which is obtained by taking the integral over the distribu#on on all areas $\\mathcal{A}_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$. Based on the above modeling, the op#miza#on problem ﬁnding UAVs' deployment loca#on and associa#on to minimize the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network can be formulated as $$ \\begin{align*} & \\mathcal{P} 1: \\text { Given : } \\beta, N, M, f(x, y), \\mathcal{A}, b_{1}, b_{2}, K_{o}, B_{u}, B_{v}, \\sigma_{u}^{2}, \\sigma_{v}^{2} \\\\ & \\text { Find : } \\Omega, l_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N} \\\\"),

To proceed, how deployment and associa#on aﬀect the power consump#on of the ground users and UAVs should be described ﬁrstly.  To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$. From (5), it can be observed that $p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)$ is mainly determined by $d_{i}^{2}(x, y)$. Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is. Therefore, the transmit power of the ground users will be op#mized through designing UAVs' deployment and associa#on in the following sec#on.  For UAV-base sta#on transmission, UAV $i$ at loca#on $l_{i}$ will collect all the ground users' data in cell $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and forward them to the remote base sta#on at $\\le{(x_{0}, y_{0}, h_{b}\\right)$.

The ﬁrst phase ends when the UAV receives all the task data from the vehicle $k$.  Similar to the literature [17], we assume that there is complete granularity in the computa5onal task data par55on and the vehicle computa5onal task data can be divided into arbitrary propor5ons for oﬄoading. Therefore, in the second stage we use a par5al oﬄoading model where the UAV is able to divide the computa5onal tasks of vehicle $k$ into ﬁve parts. the UAV processes a part locally and forwards the remaining part to the ground RSUs for processing via relay.  Finally, in the third stage, the ground base sta5on performs priority weight calcula5on for some of the tasks received from vehicle $k$ and allocates computa5onal resources for processing according to the priority weight. In most computa5onally intensive applica5ons, such as face recogni5on and video analysis, the delay and energy consump5on required to process the results of the computa5onal tasks back to the vehicle side is much smaller than the delay and energy consump5on of the oﬄoading of the vehicle computa5onal tasks, so we ignore them [18].  \\sec5on*{A. COMMUNICATION MODEL}  When the UAV ﬂies at a certain al5tude to communicate with the vehicle, the communica5on channel between the UAV and the vehicle $k$ and the RSUs is dominated by the line of sight transmission (LoS) link [19], so the channel between the UAV and the vehicle and the channel between the UAV and the RSUs uses a free-space path loss model. The channel gain between the vehicle and the UAV is expressed as $$ \\begin{equa5on*} h_{k}^{u} \\triangleq \\alpha_{0}\\let(d_{k}^{u}\\right)^{-2}=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{H^{2}+\\let\\|q^{u}-q^{k}\\right\\|^{2}} \\tag{1} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $\\alpha_{0}$ denotes the received power when the reference distance is 1 m and the transmission power is $1 W, d_{k}^{u}$ denotes the transmission distance between the mobile user and the UAV, and $\\|x\\|$ denotes he Euclidean parametriza5on of the vector. Similarly, the link gain from the UAV to the ground RSUi can be expressed as $$ \\begin{equa5on*} h_{i}^{u} \\triangleq \\alpha_{0}\\let(d_{i}^{u}\\right)^{-2}=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{H^{2}+\\let\\|q^{u}-q^{i}\\right\\|^{2}}, \\tag{2} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $d_{i}^{u}$ denotes the downlink transmission distance from the UAV to RSUi.  To eliminate the signal interference between the vehicles and to simplify the system model, the frequency division mul5ple access (OFDMA) technique is used for data transmission between the UAV and the vehicle.

In this paper, we assume that if the DBS is placed above a predeﬁned al"tude, denoted as $h^{\\text {min }}$, LoS can be maintained between the MBS and the DBS.

System Models}  The major nota"ons in the system models and problem formula"on are listed Table I. Assume that a DBS will be placed over or near a PoI to assist the users in the PoI in downloading traﬃc from an MBS via the DBS. Denote $(x, y)$ as the 2D coordinates of the DBS on a horizontal plane. Denote $h$ as the al"tude of the DBS. Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of users in the PoI and $i$ be the index of these users. Denote $\\le~(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ as the 2D coordinates of user $i$. Also, denote $\\varphi_{i}$ as user $i$ \'s data rate requirement. Thus, the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i$ is $$ \\begin{equa"on*} d_{i}=\\sqrt{l_{i}^{2}+h^{2}} \\tag{1} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $l_{i}=\\sqrt{\\le~(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le~(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}}$ is the horizontal distance between user $i$ and the DBS.  \\sec"on*{A. Pathloss Model Between the DBS and the Users}  The wireless propaga"on channel between a DBS and a user can be divided into two scenarios, i.e., the link between a DBS and a user with LoS and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) connec"ons [26], [35], [36]. The pathloss in LoS is lower than that in NLoS since the signals from the DBS may suﬀer from much stronger reﬂec"ons and diﬀrac"on in NLoS [37], [38]. Thus, the average pathloss (in dB ) between a DBS and user $i$ can be es"mated by $$ \\begin{equa"on*} \\eta_{i}=20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)+\\rho_{i} \\xi^{l o s}+\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{n l o s} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $f_{c}$ is the carrier frequency, $d_{i}$ is the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i, c$ is the speed of light, $\\rho_{i}$ is the probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\xi^{l o s}$ and $\\xi^{\\text {nlos }}$ are the average addi"onal pathloss for the LoS and NLoS scenarios, respec"vely.

Constraint (10) indicates that the amount of bandwidth allocated to the users in the PoI should be no larger than the total amount of available bandwidth. Constraint (11) means that the achievable data rate of the FSO-based backhaul link should be no less than the sum of the achievable data rates from the DBS to the sa"sﬁed users in the PoI. Constraint (12) implies that, for each sa"sﬁed user, its achievable data rate should be no less than its data rate requirement. Constraint (13) deﬁnes the minimum and maximum al"tude of the DBS.  \\sec"on*{V. Backhaul-Aware Bandwidth Alloca"on and DBS Placement}  In order to eﬃciently solve $P 0$, we design the Backhaul awaRe bandwidth allOcA"on and DBS placement (BROAD) algorithm. The basic idea of BROAD is to decompose $P 0$ into two sub-problems, i.e., user access control (denoted as $P 1$ ) and DBS placement (denoted as $P 2$ ), and itera"vely solve the two sub-problems un"l the number of the sa"sﬁed users cannot be further increased. Note that, to maximize the number of sa"sﬁed users, we need to minimize the allocated bandwidth to the sa"sﬁed users, while sa"sfying their data rate requirements. So, it is straigh\x82orward to allocate the exact amount of bandwidth to a certain user to sa"sfy its data rate requirement, i.e., $r_{i}^{a c c e s s}=\\varphi_{i}$. That is, $$ \\begin{equa"on*} b_{i}=\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{\\log _{2}\\le~(1+\\frac{p^{d} 10-\\frac{\\eta_{i}}{10}}{N_{0}}\\right)} . \\tag{15} \\end{equa"on*} $$  \\footnotetext{ ${ }^{2}$ Note that diﬀerent horizontal loca"ons may have diﬀerent minimum height requirements to ensure LoS between the MBS and the DBS.

[31] designed a heuris"c algorithm to op"mize the mul"-DBS deployment, user associa"on, and bandwidth alloca"on in disaster-struck scenarios, where all the MBSs in a disaster-struck area are damaged and DBSs are deployed over the area to provide emergency communica"ons.  Some works explored the backhaul-aware DBS placement in drone-assisted mobile networks, where tradi"onal RF communica"ons are applied as the backhaul solu"on. Kalantari et al. [32] designed a heuris"c algorithm to determine DBS placement and bandwidth alloca"on such that the number of users, whose pathloss to the DBS is larger than the predeﬁned threshold, can be maximized, while guaranteeing the overall throughput of access network no larger than the capacity of the wireless backhaul link. However, they assumed that the capacity of the backhaul link does not change by varying the DBS placement, which may not be a prac"cal assump"on. Sun and Ansari [33] assumed that the DBS is operated in the in-band half-duplex mode, i.e., backhaul and access link communica"ons are conducted over the same frequency band but in diﬀerent "me slots. They designed a heuris"c algorithm to op"mize the DBS placement and user associa"on to maximize the overall spectral eﬃciency in a PoI. Zhang et al. [34] proposed a heuris"c algorithm to maximize the overall throughput by op"mizing the DBS placement, and bandwidth and power alloca"on in both backhaul and access links, where the DBS is operated in the in-band full-duplex mode. \\begin{tabular}{ll}  & \\mul"column{1}{c}{\\begin{tabular}{c}  TABLE I \\\\ Nota"ons \\end{tabular}} \\\\ \\hline Nota"on & Deﬁni"on \\\\ \\hline $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal { I }}$ & Set of ground users in the PoI \\\\ $d_{i}$ & 3D distance between the DBS and user $i$ \\\\ $\\eta_{i}$ & Pathloss between the DBS and user $i$ \\\\ $f_{c}$ & Carrier frequency in the wireless access network \\\\ $\\rho_{i}$ & Probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$ \\\\ $\\xi^{l o s} / \\xi^{n l o s}$ & Average addi"onal pathloss for LoS/NLoS \\\\ $\\theta_{i}$ & Eleva"on angle between the DBS and user $i$ \\\\ $p^{f s o}$ & Transmission power of the FSO transmiver at the MBS \\\\ $\\tau^{t x} / \\tau^{r x}$ & Op"cal eﬃciency of the FSO transmiver/receiver \\\\ $\\gamma$ & Atmospheric avenua"on factor \\\\ $v$ & Visibility distance \\\\ $\\lambda$ & Wavelength of the op"cal beam \\\\ $L$ & 3D distance between the MBS and the DBS \\\\ $\\vartheta$ & Diameter of the op"cal receiver\'s aperture \\\\ $\\varepsilon$ & Divergence angle of FSO transmiver \\\\ $E_{p}$ & Photon energy at wavelength $\\lambda$ \\\\ $\\kappa$ & Planck constant \\\\ $c$ & Speed of light \\\\')]}

           '\n'
           'Hmm, I remember that in communication systems, the total power '
           'consumption usually includes both the circuit power and the '
           'transmit power. The formula might look something like P_total = P₀ '
           '+ P_tx, where P_tx is the transmit power. But wait, sometimes the '

           'Let me think about this step by step. First, I need to convert the '

           'given in Watts. I know that 1 dBm is equal to 0.001 Watts, so 38 '
           'dBm would be 10^(38/10) * 0.001. Let me calculate that:\n'
           '\n'
           "10^(3.8) is approximately 6309.573, but wait, no, that's not right "
           'because 10^3 is 1000 and 10^0.8 is about 6.30957. So multiplying '
           'those gives 6309.573 mW or 6.309573 Watts.\n'
           '\n'
           'Wait, actually, to convert dBm to Watts, the formula is P = '
           '10^(dBm/10) * 1e-3. So for 38 dBm:\n'
           '\n'
           'P_tx = 10^(38/10) * 0.001 = 10^3.8 * 0.001.\n'
           '\n'
           "Calculating 10^3.8: Let's break it down. 10^3 is 1000, and 10^0.8 "
           'is approximately 6.30957. So 1000 * 6.30957 = 6309.57 mW, which is '
           '6.30957 Watts.\n'
           '\n'
           'Now, considering the amplifier efficiency (η). I think the '
           'transmit power relates to the output power of the amplifier, and η '
           'is the ratio of the output power to the input power. So if P_tx is '
           'the output, then the input power would be P_tx / η. But wait, '
           "sometimes it's the other way around—efficiency could be output "
           'over input, so maybe the actual power consumed by the amplifier is '
           'P_tx / η.\n'
           '\n'
           'So the total communication power consumption might be the circuit '

           '\n'
           'Wait, but I should double-check if the formula is correct. '
           'Sometimes, the transmit power already accounts for the efficiency, '
           "so maybe we don't need to divide by η again. Alternatively, "
           'perhaps the total power is P₀ plus the transmit power adjusted by '
           'efficiency.\n'
           '\n'
           'Alternatively, another approach: The power consumed by the '
           'amplifier (PA) is related to the transmit power and efficiency as '
           'PA = P_tx / η. So if η is 2.6, then PA = 6.30957 W / 2.6 ≈ 2.42716 '
           'W.\n'
           '\n'
           'Adding that to the circuit power gives total communication power: '

           '\n'
           'But wait, sometimes in these models, especially in base stations, '
           'the total power is P₀ plus the transmit power multiplied by a '

           'confusing anything here.\n'
           '\n'
           'Alternatively, maybe the formula is P_comm = P₀ + (P_tx * η), but '
           "that would give a much higher number, which doesn't seem right "
           'because efficiency should reduce the required input power for a '

It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission. Aggrega#ng all the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network together yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} P=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}_{i}}\\le{[p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)+p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)\\right] f(x, y) d x d y \\tag{11} \\end{equa#on*} $$ which is obtained by taking the integral over the distribu#on on all areas $\\mathcal{A}_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$.

Consequently, propulsion energy consump"on can be $E_{i}^{p}(t)=\\lef(P_{h}+P_{f}\\lef(v_{i}(t)\\right)\\right) \\cdot t$, where individual UAV velocity, $v_{i}(t)$ is determined by trajectory control.  \\subsec"on*{4.4.2. Communica"on energy consump"on}  For power consump"on for communica"on, UAVs use transmission power according to data rate. For instance, Soekris device consumes measured energy like 1.58 and 1.14 W as $P_{t x}$ and $P_{r x}$, respec"vely for 48 Mbps data rate with MCS 64-QAM $2 / 3$ [48]. Therefore, energy consump"on on A2 A and A2G links is varying with user traﬃc on them.  Power consump"on of an inter-UAV link $i j$ for the A2 A communica"ons consists of sta"c power consump"on of an ac"ve transceiver, $P_{0_{i}}=3.5 \\mathrm{~W}$ and dynamic power consump"on loaded by the amount of user data rate, $P_{i j}^{a 2 a}=P_{0_{i}}+P_{\\max }^{a 2 a} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}} f_{i j}^{u}}{r_{i j}^{\\max }}$ , where dynamic power consump"on of a A2 A link, $i j$ can be derived by propor"onal transmission power to maximum value $P_{\\max }^{a 2 a}$, which is traﬃc load on the A2 A link, i.e., aggregated user data rate, $\\sum_{u} f_{i j}^{u}$ over achievable data rate $r_{i j}^{\\max }$.  The total power consump"on of each UAV $i$ for A2 A links is $P_{i}^{a 2 a}=\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}} P_{i j}^{a 2 a}$ For A2G communica"on, an UAV as an air base sta"on provides sub-channels of OFDMA to mobile users. Similar to the A2 A communica"on, the power consump"on of the A2G link can be approximated by the user data rate. Power consump"on of the A2G communica"on is formulated as below, $P_{i}^{a 2 g}=P_{0_{i}}+\\Delta_{p} \\cdot \\frac{P_{\\max }^{a 2 g}}{\\lef|U_{i}\\right|} \\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}_{i}} \\min \\lef(\\frac{f_{i u}^{u}}{r_{i u}}, 1\\right), \\quad \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ , where sta"c power consump"on $P_{0_{i}}$ is 6.8 W and $\\Delta_{p}$ is 4 as a mul"plier for load-dependent power consump"on, which is comparable with pico-cell power consump"on [49]. Similarly, the transmission power on each A2G link iu can be scaled by user data rate $f_{i u}$ against link capacity, $r_{i u}$ with bandwidth $B_{i u}$ assigned for the GMU $u$; the access link bandwidth is evenly assigned to the individual user in this study.

To proceed, how deployment and associa#on aﬀect the power consump#on of the ground users and UAVs should be described ﬁrstly.  To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$. From (5), it can be observed that $p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)$ is mainly determined by $d_{i}^{2}(x, y)$. Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is. Therefore, the transmit power of the ground users will be op#mized through designing UAVs' deployment and associa#on in the following sec#on.  For UAV-base sta#on transmission, UAV $i$ at loca#on $l_{i}$ will collect all the ground users' data in cell $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and forward them to the remote base sta#on at $\\le{(x_{0}, y_{0}, h_{b}\\right)$.

It is noteworthy that all of these works assumed the drones operated independently as ﬂying base sta#ons. In UAVassisted cellular networks, where UAVs work as relays, the results in [29] and [30] can not be directly adopted. This is because the backhaul communica#ons between ﬂying UAVs and base sta#ons were not considered. As far as we know, designing the energy-eﬃcient deployment and associa#on scheme for UAV-assisted cellular networks based on sta#s#cal user posi#on informa#on is s#ll an open problem.  \\sec#on*{B. Our Work and Contribu#ons}  As discussed above, the power consump#on of UAVs and ground users is one of the key concerns in UAV-assisted cellular networks, which depends highly on UAVs' deployment and associa#on schemes. Most of the prior works developed corresponding schemes based on the assump#on that instantaneous user posi#ons. Only a few works are done based on sta#s#cal user posi#on. These works assume that UAV acts as the base sta#on, and try to minimize the power consump#on of UAVs. Against this background, we take both ground users-UAVs and UAVs-base sta#on transmissions into account, and try to minimize the transmit power consump#on of UAV-assisted cellular networks through UAV deployment and associa#on scheme design in this work. The main contribu#ons of our work can be summarized as follows: - Based on the sta#s#cal user posi#on informa#on, the transmit power consump#on minimiza#on problem for both the ground users and UAVs is formulated. How to minimize power consump#on through deployment and associa#on design is mathema#cally described. - To solve the formulated problem, we discre#ze the space where UAVs can be located. A{er that, we transform the UAVs deployment and associa#on as a Markov decision process and use a centralized mul#-agent $Q$-learning algorithm to determine the posi#ons of UAVs. ![](hrps://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_03_174de96586dcb7851d39g-03.jpg?height=608&width=784&top_le{_y=214&top_le{_x=215)  Fig. 1. UAV-assisted cellular network system model. - In the training process of the $Q$-learning, the reward for a state with ﬁxed UAV posi#ons is computed by developing the op#mal associa#on scheme and then compu#ng its corresponding power consump#on. Speciﬁcally, we introduce the op#mal transport theory to ﬁnd out the op#mal associa#on. The uniqueness of the op#mal associa#on is proved and an itera#ve algorithm is adopted to approach the op#mal associa#on. - It has been shown that the deployment and associa#on scheme obtained based on the proposed algorithms can match any given sta#s#cal user posi#on and minimize the transmit power consump#on accordingly. The convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithms are analyzed. Simula#ons are done and results show the superiority of the proposed scheme.  \\sec#on*{C.

We have considered the Rayleigh fading model in this work because it is a commonly used model for mul"path interference in wireless communica"on systems, where the received signal power is assumed to ﬂuctuate randomly due to construc"ve and destruc"ve interference from mul"ple paths. Moreover, it is a simple and easily tractable model, making it convenient for theore"cal analysis. Addi"onally, it is assumed that the UAV-BS is equipped with an omnidirec"onal antenna and that each UE can receive the UAV-BS\'s signal equally in all direc"ons.  \\subsec"on*{3.1. UAV-BS power consump"on}  The power consump"on of the UAV-BS has two parts: hovering and communica"on. ${ }^{1}$ A rotary-wing UAV is considered in this work because of its ability to hover in a ﬁxed posi"on. - Power consump"on due to hovering of the UAV is [41]: $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P_{\\mathrm{hov}}=\\frac{\\delta_{\\mathrm{c}}}{8} \\rho r_{s} A B_{V}^{3} R_{r}^{3}+(1+\\kappa) \\frac{W^{2 / 3}}{\\sqrt{2 \\rho A}} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ - Power consump"on due to communica"on is [42,43]: $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P_{\\mathrm{com}}=P_{\\mathrm{o}}+\\tau_{t} \\eta P \\tag{3} \\end{equa"on*} $$  The total power consump"on of the UAV-BS, $P_{\\text {total }}$ can be expressed as the sum of the power consump"on due to hovering and that due to communica"on and is given by: $P_{\\text {total }}=P_{\\text {hov }}+P_{\\text {com }}$. The parameters in (2) and (3) are deﬁned in Table 1. It should be noted that even though there are other components of the UAV energy consump"on such as that due to UAV communica"on with the ground sta"on and its movement from one loca"on to another as considered in [44], we have not considered them in this work because we assume that such power consump"on is the same for both hovering and LS deployment. This is because, in both deployment scenarios, the UAV-BS s"ll has to move from one hovering posi"on or one LS to another which also requires communica"on and control from the ground sta"on.  In addi"on, we assume that the UAV-BS always maintains some amount of energy to reach the required LS. However, in a real network scenario, more than one UAV-BSs would be present in the network and there would also be other charging sta"on in the network asides the one at the LS. As a result, if the ba?ery of a given UAV is not suﬃcient  \\footnotetext{'),

Coverage probability, transmit power, and throughput analysis}  In this sec"on, closed-form expressions for ﬁnding the coverage probability, minimum transmit power required to maintain the same coverage probability at the OHP using the LS, and the throughput are derived using stochas"c geometry. The results obtained from these closed-form expressions are then compared with those obtained using simula"ons in sec"on 5.5 in order to ascertain their validity.  \\subsec"on*{4.1. Coverage probability analysis}  The UAV network is assumed not to receive interference from other BSs. Thus, the coverage probability can be expressed as: $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\lambda)=\\mathbb{P}(\\Gamma>\\lambda)$, where $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is probability that $\\Gamma>\\lambda$ over the en"re circular area with radius $R$ centered at the origin, $O$. $\\lambda$ represents the minimum threshold value of signal to noise ra"o $(\\Gamma)$ that is required for reliable communica"on.  For a given distance $R_{i}$ from the UAV posi"on to UE, the $\\Gamma$ is given as $\\Gamma_{i}=\\frac{D_{o}\\leM(\\frac{R_{0}}{R_{i}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\cdot\\leM(H_{i}\\right)^{2} \\cdot P}{N}$, where $D_{0}$ represents the fading power gains from a typical UE to the UAV, $R_{i}$ is the distance from the UAV loca"on to a typical UE which is given as $R_{i}=\\sqrt{h^{2}+\\Delta^{2}+v^{2}-2 \\Delta v \\cos \\theta}$ and $N$ is the system noise, and $P$ is the transmi?ed power.

Inter-UAV communica"ons}  The UAVs are supposed to communicate with each other using WLAN technologies such as IEEE 802.11a/g/n within several hundred meters. The air-to-air (A2 A) communica"on link is determined by a par"cularly dominant line-of-sight (LOS) link, while ground reﬂec"on is varying with al"tude. The A2 A communica"on links can be characterized by the Rice model that reﬂects strength of dominant LOS ( $\\rho$ ) and non-dominant NLOS paths ( $\\sigma$ ) and its probability density func"on is as below. $f(x \\mid \\rho, \\sigma)=\\frac{x}{\\sigma^{2}} \\exp \\lef(\\frac{-x^{2}-\\rho^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right) I_{0}\\lef(\\frac{x \\rho}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$ The Rician fading is shaped by the factor $\\mathrm{K}\\lef(\\rho_{0}, \\sigma\\right)=\\frac{\\rho_{0}^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}$ which is varying with the UAV al"tude, $h$ and can be approximated by a func"on of the height, $\\sigma=a h^{b}+c, a=212.3, b=-2.221, c=1.289$ and $\\rho_{0}=6.469$ [43]. Low al"tude that has no dominant path $(\\rho=0)$ follows Rayleigh fading.  The Rician fading channel, $h_{i, j}(n)$ between a node $i$ and $j$ is $h_{i, j}(n)=\\sqrt{\\beta_{i, j}(n)}\\lef[\\frac{h_{i, j}^{N \\operatorname{LOS}}(n)+\\sqrt{K} h_{i, j}^{\\operatorname{LOS}}(n)}{\\sqrt{1+K}}\\right]$, where $h_{i, j}^{N L O S}(n)$ is the zero-mean complex Gaussian process for sca_ering/diﬀuse, $\\sim \\mathcal{C \\mathcal { N }}(0,1)$ and $h_{i, j}^{L O S}(n)$ is the specular LOS component as determinis"c complex exponen"al, $e^{j 2 \\pi f_{d} \\cos \\theta t+\\phi}$ with angle of arrival (AoA) $\\theta$ and phase $\\phi$, and $\\lef|h_{i, j}^{L O S}(n)\\right|=1$.  \\subsec"on*{4.3.3.

The communica"on related energy includes that for communica"on circuitry, signal processing, signal radia"on/recep"on, etc. In this paper, we assume that the communica"on related power is a constant, which is denoted as $P_{c}$ in wat (W). On the other hand, the propulsion energy consump"on is needed to keep the UAV alom and support its movement, if necessary. In general, the propulsion energy depends on the UAV ﬂying speed as well as its accelera"on. In this paper, for the purpose of exposi"on and drawing the essen"al design insight, we ignore the addi"onal energy consump"on caused by UAV accelera"on, which is valid for typical communica"on applica"ons where UAV manoeuvring "me only takes a small por"on of the total opera"on "me. As derived in Appendix A for a rotary-wing UAV ﬂying with speed $V$, the propulsion power consump"on can be modeled as $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P(V)=\\underbrace{P_{0}\\lem(1+\\frac{3 V^{2}}{U_{\\text {"p }}^{2}}\\right)}_{\\text {blade proﬁle }}+\\underbrace{P_{i}\\lem(\\sqrt{1+\\frac{V^{4}}{4 v_{0}^{4}}}-\\frac{V^{2}}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{1 / 2}}_{\\text {induced }}+\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} d_{0} \\rho s A V^{3}}_{\\text {parasite }}, \\tag{6} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $P_{0}$ and $P_{i}$ are two constants deﬁned in (61) of Appendix A represen"ng the blade proﬁle power and induced power in hovering status, respec"vely, $U_{\\text {"p }}$ denotes the "p speed of the rotor blade, $v_{0}$ is known as the mean rotor induced velocity in hover, $d_{0}$ and $s$ are the fuselage drag ra"o and rotor solidity, respec"vely, and $\\rho$ and $A$ denote the air density and rotor disc area, respec"vely. The relevant parameters are explained in details in Table $\\square$ and Appendix A It is observed from (6) that the propulsion power consump"on of rotary-wing UAVs consists of three components: blade proﬁle, induced, and parasite power. The blade proﬁle power and parasite power, which increase quadra"cally and cubically with $V$, respec"vely, are needed to overcome the proﬁle drag of the blades and the fuselage drag, respec"vely. On the other hand, the induced power is that required to overcome the induced drag of the blades, which decreases with $V$.  By subs"tu"ng $V=0$ into (6), we obtain the power consump"on for hovering status as $P_{h}=P_{0}+P_{i}$, which is a ﬁnite value depending on the aircram weight, air density, and rotor disc area, etc. (see (61) in Appendix A for details). As $V$ increases, it can be veriﬁed that $P(V)$ in (6) ﬁrstly decreases and then increases with $V$, i.e., hovering is in general not the most power-conserving status. It can be veriﬁed that the power func"on $P(V)$ in (6) is neither convex nor concave with respect to $V$. It is much more involved compared to the power model for ﬁxed-wing UAV (cf. Equa"on (7) of [25]), which is a convex func"on consis"ng of two simple terms: one increasing cubically and the other decreasing inversely with $V$.  When $V \\gg v_{0}$, by applying the ﬁrst-order Taylor approxima"on $(1+x)^{1 / 2} \\approx 1+\\frac{1}{2} x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$, (6) can be approximated as a convex func"on, i.e., $$ \\begin{equa"on*}'),

Two par"cular UAV speeds that are of high prac"cal interests are the maximum-endurance $(M E)$ speed and the maximum-range $(M R)$ speed, which are denoted as $V_{\\mathrm{me}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{mr}}$, respec"vely.  ME speed: By deﬁni"on, the ME speed $V_{\\mathrm{me}}$ is the op"mal UAV speed that maximizes the UAV endurance under any given onboard energy $E$. With $E$ given, the UAV endurance with constant speed $V$ is given by $\\frac{E}{P(V)}$. Thus, $V_{\\mathrm{me}}$ is the op"mal UAV speed that minimizes the power consump"on, i.e., $V_{\\mathrm{me}}=\\arg \\min _{V \\geq 0} P(V)$ Though a closed-form expression for $V_{\\mathrm{me}}$ is diﬃcult to obtain due to the complicated expression of $P(V)$ in (6), it can be eﬃciently found numerically.

Alterna"vely, $V_{\\mathrm{mr}}$ can also be obtained graphically based on the power-speed curve $P(V)$, by drawing the tangen"al line from the origin to the power curve that corresponds to the minimum slope (and hence power/speed ra"o) [34], as illustrated in Fig. 1. In prac"ce, we usually have $V_{\\mathrm{me}} \\leq V_{\\mathrm{mr}} \\leq V_{\\max }$.  With given UAV trajectory $\\{\\mathbf{q}(t)\\}$, the propulsion energy consump"on can be expressed as'),

However, most applica"ons of UAVs for wireless communica"on provisioning are not feasible as researchers fail to consider some vital aspects of their deployment, especially the energy requirements of both the UAV and communica"on system. The considerable energy consump"on overhead involved in ﬂying or hovering UAVs makes them less appealing for green wireless communica"ons. Therefore, in this work, we examine the feasibility of an alterna"ve energy-eﬃcient deployment scheme where UAVs can be made to land-on designated loca"ons, also known as landing sta"ons (LSs). The idea of LS makes the UAVbased wireless communica"on more durable and advantageous, since the total energy consump"on is reduced by minimizing the ﬂying/hovering energy consump"on, which, in turn, enables diverse set of applica"ons including emergency and pop-up networking. We evaluate the impact of the separa"on distance between these LSs and the Op"mal Hovering Posi"on (OHP) on the network performance. Speciﬁcally, we develop mathema"cal frameworks to model the rela"onship between UAV power consump"on, coverage probability, throughput, and separa"on distance. Numerical results reveal that a signiﬁcant energy reduc"on can be achieved when the LS concept is exploited with a slight compromise in coverage probability and throughput. However, the choice of a suitable LS loca"on depends on the users\' service requirements, transmit power, and frequency band u"lized.'),

It can be shown that for any given thrust $T$ or $\\kappa, v_{i 0}$ is a decreasing func"on of $V$. By subs"tu"ng (65) into (64), the required power for forward ﬂight can be more explicitly writen as $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P(V, \\kappa)=\\underbrace{P_{0}\\lem(1+\\frac{3 V^{2}}{\\Omega^{2} R^{2}}\\right)}_{\\text {blade proﬁle }}+\\underbrace{P_{i} \\kappa\\lem(\\sqrt{\\kappa^{2}+\\frac{V^{4}}{4 v_{0}^{4}}}-\\frac{V^{2}}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{1 / 2}}_{\\text {induced }}+\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} d_{0} \\rho s A V^{3}}_{\\text {parasite }}, \\tag{66} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $P_{0}$ and $P_{i}$ are two constants deﬁned in (61). To obtain a more explicit expression of the required power in (66), we need to determine the rotor thrust $T$ or the thrust-to-weight ra"o $\\kappa$. Fig. 7 shows simpliﬁed schema"cs of the longitudinal forces ac"ng on the aircram in straight level ﬂight (see also Figure 13.2 of [34]), which include the following forces: (i) $T$ : rotor thrust, normal to the disc plane and directed upward; (ii) $D$ : drag of fuselage, which is in the opposite direc"on of the aircram velocity; and (iii) $W$ : the aircram weight. Due to the balance of forces in ver"cal direc"on, we have $T \\cos \\alpha_{T}=W$, where $\\alpha_{T}$ is the "lt angle of the rotor disc. Note that in prac"ce, $\\alpha_{T}$ is usually very small, so we have $T \\approx W$ or $\\kappa \\approx 1$ (see also Equa"on (4.3) of [33]).

It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission. Aggrega#ng all the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network together yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} P=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}_{i}}\\le{[p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)+p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)\\right] f(x, y) d x d y \\tag{11} \\end{equa#on*} $$ which is obtained by taking the integral over the distribu#on on all areas $\\mathcal{A}_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$.

To model the transmit power consump#on from ground users to their associated UAVs, we assume that the minimum transmission rate of ground users should be guaranteed, i.e., the received signal-to-noise ra#o (SNR) should be greater than the given threshold $\\beta$. With such an assump#on, the required transmit power of a user in $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ that is associated with UAV $i$ can be expressed as $$ \\begin{align*} p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right) & =\\beta \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Lambda_{i}(x, y) \\\\ & =\\beta K_{o} d_{i}^{2}(x, y) \\sigma_{u}^{2}\\le{[P_{i}^{\\mathrm{LoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{LoS}}+P_{i}^{\\mathrm{NLoS}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{NLoS}}\\right] \\tag{5} \\end{align*} $$ where the user is assumed to be located at $(x, y)$ and $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$ is the noise power which can be denoted by $\\kappa B_{u}$, with $\\kappa$ is the noise power spectral density, $B_{u}$ denotes the bandwidth of user $u$.

COMPUTATION MODEL}  We assume that processing is performed on the server of the UAV or RSU only when the task data transfer is completed. Moreover, by performing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), the server is able to dynamically allocate its computa5onal resources based on the type or number of tasks arriving [21]. Let $f_{k}^{u}$ denote the CPU resources allocated by the UAV server to the vehicle $k$ computa5onal tasks and $F^{U A V}$ denote the total CPU computa5onal resources of the UAV. Thus we can obtain the computa5onal latency and computa5onal resource constraints for the tasks on the UAV side $$ \\begin{align*} t_{c p}^{u k} & =\\frac{\\theta_{k}^{u} D_{k} C_{k}}{f_{k}^{u}}  \\tag{8}\\\\ \\sum_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}^{u} & \\leq F^{U A V} \\tag{9} \\end{align*} $$  When the data from the UAV oﬄoad is received, the RSU starts the computa5onal processing process. Compared to UAV, RSU have larger computa5onal resources. Therefore, the alloca5on of RSU computa5onal resources will dominate the comple5on delay of vehicle-aware computa5onal tasks. This also means that the proper alloca5on of computa5onal resources to RSU will directly aﬀect the judgment decision of vehicle percep5on. Thus we use hierarchical analysis (AHP) [22] to analyze the priority weight of each vehicle's data fusion task among all data fusion tasks at the current phase. Then, the computa5onal resources of the RSU are allocated according to the priority weights so as to meet the diﬀeren5ated demands of diﬀerent vehicles' computa5onal tasks. First, we construct the hierarchical model with the priority weight of the vehicle, the calcula5on task parameters $S_{k}, D_{k}, C_{k}$ and the vehicle $k$ as the target layer, the criterion layer and the solu5on layer, respec5vely. Then, according to the hierarchical model, the judgment matrix $A=\\let(a_{i j}\\right)_{n * n}$ for each layer other than the target layer is constructed, where $$ a_{i j}=\\let\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{1}{a_{i j}}=\\text { rho, rho }=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}  \\tag{10}\\\\ 1, i=j . \\end{array}\\right. $$"),

In this paper, we assume that if the DBS is placed above a predeﬁned al"tude, denoted as $h^{\\text {min }}$, LoS can be maintained between the MBS and the DBS.

System Models}  The major nota"ons in the system models and problem formula"on are listed Table I. Assume that a DBS will be placed over or near a PoI to assist the users in the PoI in downloading traﬃc from an MBS via the DBS. Denote $(x, y)$ as the 2D coordinates of the DBS on a horizontal plane. Denote $h$ as the al"tude of the DBS. Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of users in the PoI and $i$ be the index of these users. Denote $\\le~(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ as the 2D coordinates of user $i$. Also, denote $\\varphi_{i}$ as user $i$ \'s data rate requirement. Thus, the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i$ is $$ \\begin{equa"on*} d_{i}=\\sqrt{l_{i}^{2}+h^{2}} \\tag{1} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $l_{i}=\\sqrt{\\le~(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le~(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}}$ is the horizontal distance between user $i$ and the DBS.  \\sec"on*{A. Pathloss Model Between the DBS and the Users}  The wireless propaga"on channel between a DBS and a user can be divided into two scenarios, i.e., the link between a DBS and a user with LoS and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) connec"ons [26], [35], [36]. The pathloss in LoS is lower than that in NLoS since the signals from the DBS may suﬀer from much stronger reﬂec"ons and diﬀrac"on in NLoS [37], [38]. Thus, the average pathloss (in dB ) between a DBS and user $i$ can be es"mated by $$ \\begin{equa"on*} \\eta_{i}=20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)+\\rho_{i} \\xi^{l o s}+\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{n l o s} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $f_{c}$ is the carrier frequency, $d_{i}$ is the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i, c$ is the speed of light, $\\rho_{i}$ is the probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\xi^{l o s}$ and $\\xi^{\\text {nlos }}$ are the average addi"onal pathloss for the LoS and NLoS scenarios, respec"vely.

Constraint (10) indicates that the amount of bandwidth allocated to the users in the PoI should be no larger than the total amount of available bandwidth. Constraint (11) means that the achievable data rate of the FSO-based backhaul link should be no less than the sum of the achievable data rates from the DBS to the sa"sﬁed users in the PoI. Constraint (12) implies that, for each sa"sﬁed user, its achievable data rate should be no less than its data rate requirement. Constraint (13) deﬁnes the minimum and maximum al"tude of the DBS.  \\sec"on*{V. Backhaul-Aware Bandwidth Alloca"on and DBS Placement}  In order to eﬃciently solve $P 0$, we design the Backhaul awaRe bandwidth allOcA"on and DBS placement (BROAD) algorithm. The basic idea of BROAD is to decompose $P 0$ into two sub-problems, i.e., user access control (denoted as $P 1$ ) and DBS placement (denoted as $P 2$ ), and itera"vely solve the two sub-problems un"l the number of the sa"sﬁed users cannot be further increased. Note that, to maximize the number of sa"sﬁed users, we need to minimize the allocated bandwidth to the sa"sﬁed users, while sa"sfying their data rate requirements. So, it is straigh\x82orward to allocate the exact amount of bandwidth to a certain user to sa"sfy its data rate requirement, i.e., $r_{i}^{a c c e s s}=\\varphi_{i}$. That is, $$ \\begin{equa"on*} b_{i}=\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{\\log _{2}\\le~(1+\\frac{p^{d} 10-\\frac{\\eta_{i}}{10}}{N_{0}}\\right)} . \\tag{15} \\end{equa"on*} $$  \\footnotetext{ ${ }^{2}$ Note that diﬀerent horizontal loca"ons may have diﬀerent minimum height requirements to ensure LoS between the MBS and the DBS.

[31] designed a heuris"c algorithm to op"mize the mul"-DBS deployment, user associa"on, and bandwidth alloca"on in disaster-struck scenarios, where all the MBSs in a disaster-struck area are damaged and DBSs are deployed over the area to provide emergency communica"ons.  Some works explored the backhaul-aware DBS placement in drone-assisted mobile networks, where tradi"onal RF communica"ons are applied as the backhaul solu"on. Kalantari et al. [32] designed a heuris"c algorithm to determine DBS placement and bandwidth alloca"on such that the number of users, whose pathloss to the DBS is larger than the predeﬁned threshold, can be maximized, while guaranteeing the overall throughput of access network no larger than the capacity of the wireless backhaul link. However, they assumed that the capacity of the backhaul link does not change by varying the DBS placement, which may not be a prac"cal assump"on. Sun and Ansari [33] assumed that the DBS is operated in the in-band half-duplex mode, i.e., backhaul and access link communica"ons are conducted over the same frequency band but in diﬀerent "me slots. They designed a heuris"c algorithm to op"mize the DBS placement and user associa"on to maximize the overall spectral eﬃciency in a PoI. Zhang et al. [34] proposed a heuris"c algorithm to maximize the overall throughput by op"mizing the DBS placement, and bandwidth and power alloca"on in both backhaul and access links, where the DBS is operated in the in-band full-duplex mode. \\begin{tabular}{ll}  & \\mul"column{1}{c}{\\begin{tabular}{c}  TABLE I \\\\ Nota"ons \\end{tabular}} \\\\ \\hline Nota"on & Deﬁni"on \\\\ \\hline $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal { I }}$ & Set of ground users in the PoI \\\\ $d_{i}$ & 3D distance between the DBS and user $i$ \\\\ $\\eta_{i}$ & Pathloss between the DBS and user $i$ \\\\ $f_{c}$ & Carrier frequency in the wireless access network \\\\ $\\rho_{i}$ & Probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$ \\\\ $\\xi^{l o s} / \\xi^{n l o s}$ & Average addi"onal pathloss for LoS/NLoS \\\\ $\\theta_{i}$ & Eleva"on angle between the DBS and user $i$ \\\\ $p^{f s o}$ & Transmission power of the FSO transmiver at the MBS \\\\ $\\tau^{t x} / \\tau^{r x}$ & Op"cal eﬃciency of the FSO transmiver/receiver \\\\ $\\gamma$ & Atmospheric avenua"on factor \\\\ $v$ & Visibility distance \\\\ $\\lambda$ & Wavelength of the op"cal beam \\\\ $L$ & 3D distance between the MBS and the DBS \\\\ $\\vartheta$ & Diameter of the op"cal receiver\'s aperture \\\\ $\\varepsilon$ & Divergence angle of FSO transmiver \\\\ $E_{p}$ & Photon energy at wavelength $\\lambda$ \\\\ $\\kappa$ & Planck constant \\\\ $c$ & Speed of light \\\\')]}

ENERGY CONSUMPTION MODEL}  Due to the limited energy storage of UAVs, the energy consump5on management of UAVs is crucial in order to extend the opera5ng hours of UAV-assisted edge compu5ng systems. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the energy consump5on of UAV. During the whole computa5onal task comple5on process, UAV energy consump5on consists of computa5onal task recep5on energy consump5on, computa5onal task execu5on energy consump5on, and computa5onal task transmission energy consump5on. The hovering energy consump5on of the UAV is not considered in our model because it is related to the performance of the UAV itself and is not relevant to our oﬄoading decision [23]. 1) UAV computa5onal energy consump5on: We use $\\beta$ to denote the eﬀec5ve capacitance factor of the UAV, which depends on the chip structure of the CPU of the UAV [24]. Similar to the literature [25], where the computa5onal energy consump5on $f_{k}^{u}$ is propor5onal to the third power of the UAV, the UAV computa5onal energy consump5on is expressed as the product of the energy consump5on level of the UAV processing the oﬄoading task and the 5me. $$ \\begin{equa5on*} E_{k}^{c p}=\\beta\\let(f_{k}^{u}\\right)^{3} t_{c p}^{u k}=\\beta\\let(f_{k}^{u}\\right)^{2} \\theta_{k}^{u} D_{k} C_{k} \\tag{18} \\end{equa5on*} $$ 2) UAV recep5on energy consump5on: The energy consump5on of the UAV to fully receive the data of the compu5ng tasks transmiwed by the vehicle via the uplink is $$ \\begin{equa5on*} E_{k}^{R}=P^{u R} t_{k}^{u}=\\frac{D_{k} P^{u R}}{r_{k}^{u}} \\tag{19} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $P^{u R}$ is the received power of the UAV. 3) UAV transmission energy consump5on: The energy consump5on for transferring part of the oﬄoad data to the RSU via UAV is $$ \\begin{equa5on*} E_{k i}^{T}=P^{u T} t_{i}^{u k}=\\frac{\\theta_{k}^{i} D_{k} P^{u T}}{r_{i}^{u k}} \\tag{20} \\end{equa5on*} $$  \\sec5on*{III.

The communica"on related energy includes that for communica"on circuitry, signal processing, signal radia"on/recep"on, etc. In this paper, we assume that the communica"on related power is a constant, which is denoted as $P_{c}$ in wat (W). On the other hand, the propulsion energy consump"on is needed to keep the UAV alom and support its movement, if necessary. In general, the propulsion energy depends on the UAV ﬂying speed as well as its accelera"on. In this paper, for the purpose of exposi"on and drawing the essen"al design insight, we ignore the addi"onal energy consump"on caused by UAV accelera"on, which is valid for typical communica"on applica"ons where UAV manoeuvring "me only takes a small por"on of the total opera"on "me.

The relevant parameters are explained in details in Table $\\square$ and Appendix A It is observed from (6) that the propulsion power consump"on of rotary-wing UAVs consists of three components: blade proﬁle, induced, and parasite power. The blade proﬁle power and parasite power, which increase quadra"cally and cubically with $V$, respec"vely, are needed to overcome the proﬁle drag of the blades and the fuselage drag, respec"vely. On the other hand, the induced power is that required to overcome the induced drag of the blades, which decreases with $V$.  By subs"tu"ng $V=0$ into (6), we obtain the power consump"on for hovering status as $P_{h}=P_{0}+P_{i}$, which is a ﬁnite value depending on the aircram weight, air density, and rotor disc area, etc. (see (61) in Appendix A for details). As $V$ increases, it can be veriﬁed that $P(V)$ in (6) ﬁrstly decreases and then increases with $V$, i.e., hovering is in general not the most power-conserving status. It can be veriﬁed that the power func"on $P(V)$ in (6) is neither convex nor concave with respect to $V$. It is much more involved compared to the power model for ﬁxed-wing UAV (cf. Equa"on (7) of [25]), which is a convex func"on consis"ng of two simple terms: one increasing cubically and the other decreasing inversely with $V$.  When $V \\gg v_{0}$, by applying the ﬁrst-order Taylor approxima"on $(1+x)^{1 / 2} \\approx 1+\\frac{1}{2} x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$, (6) can be approximated as a convex func"on, i.e., $$ \\begin{equa"on*}'),

Coverage probability, transmit power, and throughput analysis}  In this sec"on, closed-form expressions for ﬁnding the coverage probability, minimum transmit power required to maintain the same coverage probability at the OHP using the LS, and the throughput are derived using stochas"c geometry. The results obtained from these closed-form expressions are then compared with those obtained using simula"ons in sec"on 5.5 in order to ascertain their validity.  \\subsec"on*{4.1. Coverage probability analysis}  The UAV network is assumed not to receive interference from other BSs. Thus, the coverage probability can be expressed as: $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\lambda)=\\mathbb{P}(\\Gamma>\\lambda)$, where $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is probability that $\\Gamma>\\lambda$ over the en"re circular area with radius $R$ centered at the origin, $O$. $\\lambda$ represents the minimum threshold value of signal to noise ra"o $(\\Gamma)$ that is required for reliable communica"on.  For a given distance $R_{i}$ from the UAV posi"on to UE, the $\\Gamma$ is given as $\\Gamma_{i}=\\frac{D_{o}\\leM(\\frac{R_{0}}{R_{i}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\cdot\\leM(H_{i}\\right)^{2} \\cdot P}{N}$, where $D_{0}$ represents the fading power gains from a typical UE to the UAV, $R_{i}$ is the distance from the UAV loca"on to a typical UE which is given as $R_{i}=\\sqrt{h^{2}+\\Delta^{2}+v^{2}-2 \\Delta v \\cos \\theta}$ and $N$ is the system noise, and $P$ is the transmi?ed power.  Lemma 1. The downlink coverage probability of the UAV network with the UAVs located at the LSs is given by $$ \\begin{align*} \\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{c}} & =\\frac{1}{2 \\pi R} \\int_{0}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2 \\pi} \\exp \\leM(\\frac{-\\lambda N}{D_{0} P}\\right. \\\\ & \\leM.\\"mes\\leM[\\frac{\\sqrt{h^{2}+v^{2}+\\Delta^{2}-2 \\Delta v \\cos \\theta}}{R_{0}}\\right]^{\\alpha}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta \\mathrm{~d} v . \\tag{7} \\end{align*} $$  Proof.

Thus, the transmit power for UAV $i$ to deliver one user's data to the base sta#on can be averagely computed as $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{p_{i}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)}{M a_{i}} \\tag{9} \\end{equa#on*} $$  Subs#tu#ng (4) and (6)-(8) into (9) yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{\\le{(2^{M a_{i} r_{u} / B_{v}}-1\\right) \\sigma_{v}^{2} K_{o} d_{i 0}^{2}}{M a_{i}} \\tag{10} \\end{equa#on*} $$  From (10), it is observed that the required transmit power for each UAV to relay data of one user depends not only on the UAV's posi#on $l_{i}$ (related to given deployment scheme) but also the user ra#o $a_{i}$ (related to associa#on scheme). It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission. Aggrega#ng all the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network together yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} P=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}_{i}}\\le{[p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)+p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)\\right] f(x, y) d x d y \\tag{11} \\end{equa#on*} $$ which is obtained by taking the integral over the distribu#on on all areas $\\mathcal{A}_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$. Based on the above modeling, the op#miza#on problem ﬁnding UAVs' deployment loca#on and associa#on to minimize the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network can be formulated as $$ \\begin{align*} & \\mathcal{P} 1: \\text { Given : } \\beta, N, M, f(x, y), \\mathcal{A}, b_{1}, b_{2}, K_{o}, B_{u}, B_{v}, \\sigma_{u}^{2}, \\sigma_{v}^{2} \\\\ & \\text { Find : } \\Omega, l_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N} \\\\"),

We have considered the Rayleigh fading model in this work because it is a commonly used model for mul"path interference in wireless communica"on systems, where the received signal power is assumed to ﬂuctuate randomly due to construc"ve and destruc"ve interference from mul"ple paths. Moreover, it is a simple and easily tractable model, making it convenient for theore"cal analysis. Addi"onally, it is assumed that the UAV-BS is equipped with an omnidirec"onal antenna and that each UE can receive the UAV-BS\'s signal equally in all direc"ons.  \\subsec"on*{3.1. UAV-BS power consump"on}  The power consump"on of the UAV-BS has two parts: hovering and communica"on. ${ }^{1}$ A rotary-wing UAV is considered in this work because of its ability to hover in a ﬁxed posi"on. - Power consump"on due to hovering of the UAV is [41]: $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P_{\\mathrm{hov}}=\\frac{\\delta_{\\mathrm{c}}}{8} \\rho r_{s} A B_{V}^{3} R_{r}^{3}+(1+\\kappa) \\frac{W^{2 / 3}}{\\sqrt{2 \\rho A}} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ - Power consump"on due to communica"on is [42,43]: $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P_{\\mathrm{com}}=P_{\\mathrm{o}}+\\tau_{t} \\eta P \\tag{3} \\end{equa"on*} $$  The total power consump"on of the UAV-BS, $P_{\\text {total }}$ can be expressed as the sum of the power consump"on due to hovering and that due to communica"on and is given by: $P_{\\text {total }}=P_{\\text {hov }}+P_{\\text {com }}$. The parameters in (2) and (3) are deﬁned in Table 1. It should be noted that even though there are other components of the UAV energy consump"on such as that due to UAV communica"on with the ground sta"on and its movement from one loca"on to another as considered in [44], we have not considered them in this work because we assume that such power consump"on is the same for both hovering and LS deployment. This is because, in both deployment scenarios, the UAV-BS s"ll has to move from one hovering posi"on or one LS to another which also requires communica"on and control from the ground sta"on.  In addi"on, we assume that the UAV-BS always maintains some amount of energy to reach the required LS. However, in a real network scenario, more than one UAV-BSs would be present in the network and there would also be other charging sta"on in the network asides the one at the LS.

The communica"on related energy includes that for communica"on circuitry, signal processing, signal radia"on/recep"on, etc. In this paper, we assume that the communica"on related power is a constant, which is denoted as $P_{c}$ in wat (W). On the other hand, the propulsion energy consump"on is needed to keep the UAV alom and support its movement, if necessary. In general, the propulsion energy depends on the UAV ﬂying speed as well as its accelera"on. In this paper, for the purpose of exposi"on and drawing the essen"al design insight, we ignore the addi"onal energy consump"on caused by UAV accelera"on, which is valid for typical communica"on applica"ons where UAV manoeuvring "me only takes a small por"on of the total opera"on "me. As derived in Appendix A for a rotary-wing UAV ﬂying with speed $V$, the propulsion power consump"on can be modeled as $$ \\begin{equa"on*} P(V)=\\underbrace{P_{0}\\lem(1+\\frac{3 V^{2}}{U_{\\text {"p }}^{2}}\\right)}_{\\text {blade proﬁle }}+\\underbrace{P_{i}\\lem(\\sqrt{1+\\frac{V^{4}}{4 v_{0}^{4}}}-\\frac{V^{2}}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{1 / 2}}_{\\text {induced }}+\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} d_{0} \\rho s A V^{3}}_{\\text {parasite }}, \\tag{6} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $P_{0}$ and $P_{i}$ are two constants deﬁned in (61) of Appendix A represen"ng the blade proﬁle power and induced power in hovering status, respec"vely, $U_{\\text {"p }}$ denotes the "p speed of the rotor blade, $v_{0}$ is known as the mean rotor induced velocity in hover, $d_{0}$ and $s$ are the fuselage drag ra"o and rotor solidity, respec"vely, and $\\rho$ and $A$ denote the air density and rotor disc area, respec"vely. The relevant parameters are explained in details in Table $\\square$ and Appendix A It is observed from (6) that the propulsion power consump"on of rotary-wing UAVs consists of three components: blade proﬁle, induced, and parasite power. The blade proﬁle power and parasite power, which increase quadra"cally and cubically with $V$, respec"vely, are needed to overcome the proﬁle drag of the blades and the fuselage drag, respec"vely. On the other hand, the induced power is that required to overcome the induced drag of the blades, which decreases with $V$.  By subs"tu"ng $V=0$ into (6), we obtain the power consump"on for hovering status as $P_{h}=P_{0}+P_{i}$, which is a ﬁnite value depending on the aircram weight, air density, and rotor disc area, etc. (see (61) in Appendix A for details). As $V$ increases, it can be veriﬁed that $P(V)$ in (6) ﬁrstly decreases and then increases with $V$, i.e., hovering is in general not the most power-conserving status. It can be veriﬁed that the power func"on $P(V)$ in (6) is neither convex nor concave with respect to $V$. It is much more involved compared to the power model for ﬁxed-wing UAV (cf. Equa"on (7) of [25]), which is a convex func"on consis"ng of two simple terms: one increasing cubically and the other decreasing inversely with $V$.  When $V \\gg v_{0}$, by applying the ﬁrst-order Taylor approxima"on $(1+x)^{1 / 2} \\approx 1+\\frac{1}{2} x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$, (6) can be approximated as a convex func"on, i.e., $$ \\begin{equa"on*}'),

ENERGY CONSUMPTION MODEL}  Due to the limited energy storage of UAVs, the energy consump5on management of UAVs is crucial in order to extend the opera5ng hours of UAV-assisted edge compu5ng systems. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the energy consump5on of UAV. During the whole computa5onal task comple5on process, UAV energy consump5on consists of computa5onal task recep5on energy consump5on, computa5onal task execu5on energy consump5on, and computa5onal task transmission energy consump5on. The hovering energy consump5on of the UAV is not considered in our model because it is related to the performance of the UAV itself and is not relevant to our oﬄoading decision [23]. 1) UAV computa5onal energy consump5on: We use $\\beta$ to denote the eﬀec5ve capacitance factor of the UAV, which depends on the chip structure of the CPU of the UAV [24]. Similar to the literature [25], where the computa5onal energy consump5on $f_{k}^{u}$ is propor5onal to the third power of the UAV, the UAV computa5onal energy consump5on is expressed as the product of the energy consump5on level of the UAV processing the oﬄoading task and the 5me. $$ \\begin{equa5on*} E_{k}^{c p}=\\beta\\let(f_{k}^{u}\\right)^{3} t_{c p}^{u k}=\\beta\\let(f_{k}^{u}\\right)^{2} \\theta_{k}^{u} D_{k} C_{k} \\tag{18} \\end{equa5on*} $$ 2) UAV recep5on energy consump5on: The energy consump5on of the UAV to fully receive the data of the compu5ng tasks transmiwed by the vehicle via the uplink is $$ \\begin{equa5on*} E_{k}^{R}=P^{u R} t_{k}^{u}=\\frac{D_{k} P^{u R}}{r_{k}^{u}} \\tag{19} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $P^{u R}$ is the received power of the UAV. 3) UAV transmission energy consump5on: The energy consump5on for transferring part of the oﬄoad data to the RSU via UAV is $$ \\begin{equa5on*} E_{k i}^{T}=P^{u T} t_{i}^{u k}=\\frac{\\theta_{k}^{i} D_{k} P^{u T}}{r_{i}^{u k}} \\tag{20} \\end{equa5on*} $$  \\sec5on*{III.

However, the above results for ﬁxed-wing UAVs cannot be applied for rotary-wing UAVs, due to their fundamentally diﬀerent mechanical designs and hence dras"cally diﬀerent propulsion energy models. This thus mo"vates our current work to inves"gate energy-eﬃcient communica"on for rotary-wing UAVs.  In this paper, we study a wireless communica"on system enabled a rotary-wing UAV. Compared to ﬁxed-wing UAVs, rotary-wing UAVs have several appealing advantages such as the ability to take oﬀ and land ver"cally, as well as for hovering, which render them more popular in the current UAV market. We consider the scenario where a rotary-wing UAV is dispatched as a ﬂying AP to communicate with mul"ple GNs, each of which has a target number of informa"on bits to be transmited/received to/from the UAV. Such a setup corresponds to many prac"cal applica"ons, such as UAV-enabled data collec"on for periodic sensing, UAV-enabled caching where the UAV pre-fetches the data and then transmits to the designated caching nodes [32], etc. Our objec"ve is to minimize the UAV\'s energy consump"on, including both propulsion energy and communica"on energy, while ensuring that the communica"on requirement for each GN is sa"sﬁed. The main contribu"ons of this paper are summarized as follows.  First, we derive an analy"cal model for the propulsion power consump"on of rotary-wing UAVs, based on the results in aircram literature [33], [34]. As expected, the obtained model is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that for ﬁxed-wing UAVs derived in our prior work [25].  Based on the derived power consump"on model, we formulate the energy minimiza"on problem that jointly op"mizes the UAV trajectory, the communica"on "me alloca"on among the mul"ple GNs, as well as the total mission comple"on "me. The problem is diﬃcult to be op"mally solved, as it is non-convex and cons"tutes inﬁnite number of op"miza"on variables that are coupled in con"nuous func"ons over "me. To tackle this problem, we ﬁrst consider the simple ﬂy-hover-communicate design [17] to gain useful insights. Under this design, the UAV successively visits a set of op"mized hovering loca"ons, and communicates with each of the GNs only when hovering at the corresponding loca"on. In this case, the problem reduces to ﬁnding the op"mal hovering loca"ons and hovering dura"on at each loca"on, as well as the visi"ng order and ﬂying speed among these loca"ons. The problem is s"ll NP hard, as it includes the classic NP hard travelling salesman problem (TSP) as a special case [35]. By leveraging the exis"ng TSP-solving algorithm [36] and convex op"miza"on techniques, an eﬃcient high-quality approximate solu"on is obtained for our problem.  Next, we propose a general solu"on to the energy minimiza"on problem where the UAV communicates also when ﬂying. To this end, we ﬁrst propose a novel discre"za"on technique, called path discre"za"on, to transform the original problem with inﬁnitely many variables into a more tractable form with a ﬁnite number of variables. Diﬀerent from the widely used "me discre"za"on approach for UAV trajectory design (see e.g. [23] and [25]), path discre"za"on does not require the mission comple"on "me to be pre-speciﬁed. This is par"cularly useful for problems where the mission comple"on "me is also one of the op"miza"on variables, as for the energy minimiza"on problem studied in this paper. However, the path-discre"zed problem is s"ll non-convex, and thus it is challenging to ﬁnd its op"mal solu"on. By u"lizing the successive convex approxima"on (SCA) technique [23], an eﬃcient itera"ve algorithm is proposed to simultaneously update the UAV trajectory and')]}

COMPUTATION MODEL}  We assume that processing is performed on the server of the UAV or RSU only when the task data transfer is completed. Moreover, by performing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), the server is able to dynamically allocate its computa5onal resources based on the type or number of tasks arriving [21]. Let $f_{k}^{u}$ denote the CPU resources allocated by the UAV server to the vehicle $k$ computa5onal tasks and $F^{U A V}$ denote the total CPU computa5onal resources of the UAV. Thus we can obtain the computa5onal latency and computa5onal resource constraints for the tasks on the UAV side $$ \\begin{align*} t_{c p}^{u k} & =\\frac{\\theta_{k}^{u} D_{k} C_{k}}{f_{k}^{u}}  \\tag{8}\\\\ \\sum_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}^{u} & \\leq F^{U A V} \\tag{9} \\end{align*} $$  When the data from the UAV oﬄoad is received, the RSU starts the computa5onal processing process. Compared to UAV, RSU have larger computa5onal resources. Therefore, the alloca5on of RSU computa5onal resources will dominate the comple5on delay of vehicle-aware computa5onal tasks. This also means that the proper alloca5on of computa5onal resources to RSU will directly aﬀect the judgment decision of vehicle percep5on. Thus we use hierarchical analysis (AHP) [22] to analyze the priority weight of each vehicle's data fusion task among all data fusion tasks at the current phase. Then, the computa5onal resources of the RSU are allocated according to the priority weights so as to meet the diﬀeren5ated demands of diﬀerent vehicles' computa5onal tasks. First, we construct the hierarchical model with the priority weight of the vehicle, the calcula5on task parameters $S_{k}, D_{k}, C_{k}$ and the vehicle $k$ as the target layer, the criterion layer and the solu5on layer, respec5vely. Then, according to the hierarchical model, the judgment matrix $A=\\let(a_{i j}\\right)_{n * n}$ for each layer other than the target layer is constructed, where $$ a_{i j}=\\let\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{1}{a_{i j}}=\\text { rho, rho }=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}  \\tag{10}\\\\ 1, i=j . \\end{array}\\right. $$"),

The ﬁrst phase ends when the UAV receives all the task data from the vehicle $k$.  Similar to the literature [17], we assume that there is complete granularity in the computa5onal task data par55on and the vehicle computa5onal task data can be divided into arbitrary propor5ons for oﬄoading. Therefore, in the second stage we use a par5al oﬄoading model where the UAV is able to divide the computa5onal tasks of vehicle $k$ into ﬁve parts. the UAV processes a part locally and forwards the remaining part to the ground RSUs for processing via relay.  Finally, in the third stage, the ground base sta5on performs priority weight calcula5on for some of the tasks received from vehicle $k$ and allocates computa5onal resources for processing according to the priority weight. In most computa5onally intensive applica5ons, such as face recogni5on and video analysis, the delay and energy consump5on required to process the results of the computa5onal tasks back to the vehicle side is much smaller than the delay and energy consump5on of the oﬄoading of the vehicle computa5onal tasks, so we ignore them [18].  \\sec5on*{A. COMMUNICATION MODEL}  When the UAV ﬂies at a certain al5tude to communicate with the vehicle, the communica5on channel between the UAV and the vehicle $k$ and the RSUs is dominated by the line of sight transmission (LoS) link [19], so the channel between the UAV and the vehicle and the channel between the UAV and the RSUs uses a free-space path loss model. The channel gain between the vehicle and the UAV is expressed as $$ \\begin{equa5on*} h_{k}^{u} \\triangleq \\alpha_{0}\\let(d_{k}^{u}\\right)^{-2}=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{H^{2}+\\let\\|q^{u}-q^{k}\\right\\|^{2}} \\tag{1} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $\\alpha_{0}$ denotes the received power when the reference distance is 1 m and the transmission power is $1 W, d_{k}^{u}$ denotes the transmission distance between the mobile user and the UAV, and $\\|x\\|$ denotes he Euclidean parametriza5on of the vector. Similarly, the link gain from the UAV to the ground RSUi can be expressed as $$ \\begin{equa5on*} h_{i}^{u} \\triangleq \\alpha_{0}\\let(d_{i}^{u}\\right)^{-2}=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{H^{2}+\\let\\|q^{u}-q^{i}\\right\\|^{2}}, \\tag{2} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $d_{i}^{u}$ denotes the downlink transmission distance from the UAV to RSUi.  To eliminate the signal interference between the vehicles and to simplify the system model, the frequency division mul5ple access (OFDMA) technique is used for data transmission between the UAV and the vehicle.

Recall that $d_{i}(x, y)=$ $\\sqrt{\\le{(x-x_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\le{(y-y_{i}\\right)^{2}+h^{2}}$, it can be concluded that the required transmit power for ground user depends on which UAV it is associated to and where the UAV is.

For UAV-base sta#on transmission, UAV $i$ at loca#on $l_{i}$ will collect all the ground users' data in cell $\\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and forward them to the remote base sta#on at $\\le{(x_{0}, y_{0}, h_{b}\\right)$.

Denote $(x, y)$ as the 2D coordinates of the DBS on a horizontal plane. Denote $h$ as the al"tude of the DBS. Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of users in the PoI and $i$ be the index of these users. Denote $\\le~(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ as the 2D coordinates of user $i$. Also, denote $\\varphi_{i}$ as user $i$ \'s data rate requirement.

Pathloss Model Between the DBS and the Users}  The wireless propaga"on channel between a DBS and a user can be divided into two scenarios, i.e., the link between a DBS and a user with LoS and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) connec"ons [26], [35], [36]. The pathloss in LoS is lower than that in NLoS since the signals from the DBS may suﬀer from much stronger reﬂec"ons and diﬀrac"on in NLoS [37], [38]. Thus, the average pathloss (in dB ) between a DBS and user $i$ can be es"mated by $$ \\begin{equa"on*} \\eta_{i}=20 \\log _{10}\\le~(\\frac{4 \\pi f_{c} d_{i}}{c}\\right)+\\rho_{i} \\xi^{l o s}+\\le~(1-\\rho_{i}\\right) \\xi^{n l o s} \\tag{2} \\end{equa"on*} $$ where $f_{c}$ is the carrier frequency, $d_{i}$ is the 3D distance between the DBS and user $i, c$ is the speed of light, $\\rho_{i}$ is the probability of having LoS between the DBS and user $i$, and $\\xi^{l o s}$ and $\\xi^{\\text {nlos }}$ are the average addi"onal pathloss for the LoS and NLoS scenarios, respec"vely.

The basic idea of BROAD is to decompose $P 0$ into two sub-problems, i.e., user access control (denoted as $P 1$ ) and DBS placement (denoted as $P 2$ ), and itera"vely solve the two sub-problems un"l the number of the sa"sﬁed users cannot be further increased. Note that, to maximize the number of sa"sﬁed users, we need to minimize the allocated bandwidth to the sa"sﬁed users, while sa"sfying their data rate requirements. So, it is straigh\x82orward to allocate the exact amount of bandwidth to a certain user to sa"sfy its data rate requirement, i.e., $r_{i}^{a c c e s s}=\\varphi_{i}$. That is, $$ \\begin{equa"on*} b_{i}=\\frac{\\varphi_{i}}{\\log _{2}\\le~(1+\\frac{p^{d} 10-\\frac{\\eta_{i}}{10}}{N_{0}}\\right)} . \\tag{15} \\end{equa"on*} $$  \\footnotetext{ ${ }^{2}$ Note that diﬀerent horizontal loca"ons may have diﬀerent minimum height requirements to ensure LoS between the MBS and the DBS.

Thus, the transmit power for UAV $i$ to deliver one user's data to the base sta#on can be averagely computed as $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{p_{i}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)}{M a_{i}} \\tag{9} \\end{equa#on*} $$  Subs#tu#ng (4) and (6)-(8) into (9) yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)=\\frac{\\le{(2^{M a_{i} r_{u} / B_{v}}-1\\right) \\sigma_{v}^{2} K_{o} d_{i 0}^{2}}{M a_{i}} \\tag{10} \\end{equa#on*} $$  From (10), it is observed that the required transmit power for each UAV to relay data of one user depends not only on the UAV's posi#on $l_{i}$ (related to given deployment scheme) but also the user ra#o $a_{i}$ (related to associa#on scheme). It can also be seen that the transmit power consumed by a UAV will increase exponen#ally with the data rate requirement $R\\le{(a_{i}\\right)=$ $M a_{i} r_{u}$. This indicates that unbalanced loads for UAVs will lead to even bigger unbalance in power consump#on. Those UAVs with heavy transmission loads will consume much more power, and their working #me will be greatly shortened accordingly.  By now, we have obtained the required transmit power of a ground user (5) and that of its associated UAV (10) for the uplink data transmission. Aggrega#ng all the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network together yields $$ \\begin{equa#on*} P=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}_{i}}\\le{[p_{u}^{i}\\le{(x, y, l_{i}\\right)+p_{i, u}^{0}\\le{(a_{i}, l_{i}\\right)\\right] f(x, y) d x d y \\tag{11} \\end{equa#on*} $$ which is obtained by taking the integral over the distribu#on on all areas $\\mathcal{A}_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$. Based on the above modeling, the op#miza#on problem ﬁnding UAVs' deployment loca#on and associa#on to minimize the transmit power in the UAV-assisted cellular network can be formulated as $$ \\begin{align*} & \\mathcal{P} 1: \\text { Given : } \\beta, N, M, f(x, y), \\mathcal{A}, b_{1}, b_{2}, K_{o}, B_{u}, B_{v}, \\sigma_{u}^{2}, \\sigma_{v}^{2} \\\\ & \\text { Find : } \\Omega, l_{i}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N} \\\\")]}

Energy consump"on}  Energy consump"on occurs by UAV movement and wireless communica"on; energy consump"on from ﬂight is mostly about 300 W while Wi-Fi and GPS only consume several ten mW [44]. As UAVs receive instruc"on from the GCC for topology control, they consume propulsion energy to move to the next loca"on. Subsequently, they spend energy on mul"-hop wireless communica"ons to serve user traﬃc.  \\subsec"on*{4.4.1.

Meanwhile, rotary-wing UAVs have diﬀerent energy consump"on models for hovering and forward ﬂight, which are described in [47] respec"vely.

Communica"on energy consump"on}  For power consump"on for communica"on, UAVs use transmission power according to data rate. For instance, Soekris device consumes measured energy like 1.58 and 1.14 W as $P_{t x}$ and $P_{r x}$, respec"vely for 48 Mbps data rate with MCS 64-QAM $2 / 3$ [48]. Therefore, energy consump"on on A2 A and A2G links is varying with user traﬃc on them.  Power consump"on of an inter-UAV link $i j$ for the A2 A communica"ons consists of sta"c power consump"on of an ac"ve transceiver, $P_{0_{i}}=3.5 \\mathrm{~W}$ and dynamic power consump"on loaded by the amount of user data rate, $P_{i j}^{a 2 a}=P_{0_{i}}+P_{\\max }^{a 2 a} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}} f_{i j}^{u}}{r_{i j}^{\\max }}$ , where dynamic power consump"on of a A2 A link, $i j$ can be derived by propor"onal transmission power to maximum value $P_{\\max }^{a 2 a}$, which is traﬃc load on the A2 A link, i.e., aggregated user data rate, $\\sum_{u} f_{i j}^{u}$ over achievable data rate $r_{i j}^{\\max }$.  The total power consump"on of each UAV $i$ for A2 A links is $P_{i}^{a 2 a}=\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}} P_{i j}^{a 2 a}$ For A2G communica"on, an UAV as an air base sta"on provides sub-channels of OFDMA to mobile users. Similar to the A2 A communica"on, the power consump"on of the A2G link can be approximated by the user data rate. Power consump"on of the A2G communica"on is formulated as below, $P_{i}^{a 2 g}=P_{0_{i}}+\\Delta_{p} \\cdot \\frac{P_{\\max }^{a 2 g}}{\\lef|U_{i}\\right|} \\sum_{u \\in \\mathcal{V}_{i}} \\min \\lef(\\frac{f_{i u}^{u}}{r_{i u}}, 1\\right), \\quad \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ , where sta"c power consump"on $P_{0_{i}}$ is 6.8 W and $\\Delta_{p}$ is 4 as a mul"plier for load-dependent power consump"on, which is comparable with pico-cell power consump"on [49]. Similarly, the transmission power on each A2G link iu can be scaled by user data rate $f_{i u}$ against link capacity, $r_{i u}$ with bandwidth $B_{i u}$ assigned for the GMU $u$; the access link bandwidth is evenly assigned to the individual user in this study.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION MODEL}  Due to the limited energy storage of UAVs, the energy consump5on management of UAVs is crucial in order to extend the opera5ng hours of UAV-assisted edge compu5ng systems.

During the whole computa5onal task comple5on process, UAV energy consump5on consists of computa5onal task recep5on energy consump5on, computa5onal task execu5on energy consump5on, and computa5onal task transmission energy consump5on. The hovering energy consump5on of the UAV is not considered in our model because it is related to the performance of the UAV itself and is not relevant to our oﬄoading decision [23]. 1) UAV computa5onal energy consump5on: We use $\\beta$ to denote the eﬀec5ve capacitance factor of the UAV, which depends on the chip structure of the CPU of the UAV [24]. Similar to the literature [25], where the computa5onal energy consump5on $f_{k}^{u}$ is propor5onal to the third power of the UAV, the UAV computa5onal energy consump5on is expressed as the product of the energy consump5on level of the UAV processing the oﬄoading task and the 5me. $$ \\begin{equa5on*} E_{k}^{c p}=\\beta\\let(f_{k}^{u}\\right)^{3} t_{c p}^{u k}=\\beta\\let(f_{k}^{u}\\right)^{2} \\theta_{k}^{u} D_{k} C_{k} \\tag{18} \\end{equa5on*} $$ 2) UAV recep5on energy consump5on: The energy consump5on of the UAV to fully receive the data of the compu5ng tasks transmiwed by the vehicle via the uplink is $$ \\begin{equa5on*} E_{k}^{R}=P^{u R} t_{k}^{u}=\\frac{D_{k} P^{u R}}{r_{k}^{u}} \\tag{19} \\end{equa5on*} $$ where $P^{u R}$ is the received power of the UAV. 3) UAV transmission energy consump5on: The energy consump5on for transferring part of the oﬄoad data to the RSU via UAV is $$ \\begin{equa5on*} E_{k i}^{T}=P^{u T} t_{i}^{u k}=\\frac{\\theta_{k}^{i} D_{k} P^{u T}}{r_{i}^{u k}} \\tag{20} \\end{equa5on*} $$  \\sec5on*{III.
