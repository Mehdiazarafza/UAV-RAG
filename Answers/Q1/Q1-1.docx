Human expert's answer: 15.76 degrees, or 0.2715 Radaians 
*(θ=Arcsin(h/d)), d=sqrt((x-xi)^2+(y-yi)^2+(h)^2)=(65−47)^2+(73−23)^2+15^2=55.22 , θ=Arcsin(15/55.22))=15.76
​

ChatGPT's Answer: 15.8°  
*ChatGPT compute horizontal distance, dose not consider h, in distance equation, 
so is why that the final value for the theta is a little bit different, d=sqrt((x-xi)^2+(y-yi)^2)!
But the final formulation for the theta is correct!(θ=tan-1(h/d)).


Comment: 
But the answer for ChatGPT is approximately 0.282 or 15.8, so in my opinion, this is correct.
